The goal is to maximize performance while maintaining correctness.

Here are some possible optimizations you might consider:

- Replace the GEMM operation with a custom CUDA kernel that leverages shared memory for better cache locality.
- Replace the BatchNorm operation with a custom CUDA kernel that implements a more efficient version of batch normalization.
- Replace the GELU operation with a custom CUDA kernel that uses an approximation method for faster computation.
- Combine the GELU and ReLU operations into a single custom CUDA kernel for fused computation.
- Use algorithmic changes such as inplace operations to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
- Optimize data layout for better GPU utilization.
