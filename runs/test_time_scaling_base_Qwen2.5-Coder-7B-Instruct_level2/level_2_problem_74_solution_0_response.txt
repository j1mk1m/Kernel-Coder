Make sure to include any necessary imports at the beginning of your code.

Please note that you should aim to optimize the entire pipeline of operations within the Model class, including but not limited to the conv_transpose, leaky_relu, multiplication, and max_pool operations. Feel free to introduce additional helper functions or classes if needed. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining correctness.
