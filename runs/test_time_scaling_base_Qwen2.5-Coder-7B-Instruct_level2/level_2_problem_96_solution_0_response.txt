Please follow the same syntax used in the example above for defining and compiling custom CUDA operators. If you need to define multiple custom CUDA operators, define each one in its own source string and compile them separately.

For reference, here are some commonly used PyTorch operations and their equivalent CUDA kernels:

- Convolution: `nn.Conv2d`, `nn.Conv3d` can be implemented using CUDA libraries such as cuDNN.
- Transposed Convolution: `nn.ConvTranspose2d`, `nn.ConvTranspose3d` can be implemented using CUDA libraries such as cuDNN.
- Element-wise Multiplication: Can be done using CUDA's vectorized operations.
- Max Pooling: `nn.MaxPool2d`, `nn.MaxPool3d` can be implemented using CUDA libraries such as cuDNN.
- Global Average Pooling: `nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d`, `nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d` can be implemented using CUDA libraries such as cuDNN.
- Clamping: Can be done using CUDA's conditional operations.
- Activation Functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh can be implemented using CUDA's vectorized operations.

Remember that the goal is to achieve significant speedups by replacing certain PyTorch operations with custom CUDA kernels. Be creative in your choice of which operations to optimize.
