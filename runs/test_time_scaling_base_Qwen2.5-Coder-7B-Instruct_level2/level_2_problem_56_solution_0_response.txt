### Constraints:

- The solution must be implemented in Python using PyTorch and CUDA extensions.
- You can only use CUDA extensions to implement the custom operators. No other external libraries can be used.
- The original functionality of the `Model` class should be preserved.
- The implementation should aim for maximum performance improvement.

### Example Solution:

Here is an example solution where we optimize the matrix multiplication operation using a custom CUDA kernel. The resulting `ModelNew` class should perform the same operations as the original `Model`, but with improved performance due to the custom CUDA implementation.
