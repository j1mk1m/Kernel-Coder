Here are some tips:

- Consider replacing the `nn.Linear` layer with a custom CUDA kernel that performs matrix multiplication.
- Consider replacing the `nn.AvgPool1d` layer with a custom CUDA kernel that performs average pooling.
- Consider replacing the GELU activation function with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Consider replacing the `torch.max` operation with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Feel free to combine multiple operations into a single kernel.
- Feel free to change the algorithm used for any operation.

Please ensure that the final architecture is faster than the original one. You should provide evidence of the performance improvement, such as benchmarking results before and after optimization.
