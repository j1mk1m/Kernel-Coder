Here are the requirements for your solution:

- You must provide both the CUDA source code and the Python wrapper code for each custom CUDA operator.
- Your implementation should be efficient and avoid unnecessary computations.
- You should aim to reduce the overall computation time compared to the original PyTorch implementation.
- You should document any optimizations you made in the comments.

### Hint:
Consider optimizing the transposed convolution operation and the subsequent operations (addition, clamp, scale, divide) using custom CUDA kernels. You can also explore algorithmic changes such as online softmax for the clamp operation.
