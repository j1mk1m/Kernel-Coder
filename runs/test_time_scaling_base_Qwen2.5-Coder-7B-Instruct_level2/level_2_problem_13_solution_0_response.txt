## Requirements:

- Use `load_inline` from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile the CUDA code.
- Replace the transposed 3D convolution, mean pooling, addition, softmax, tanh, and scaling operations with custom CUDA kernels.
- Ensure the output tensor shape remains consistent with the original architecture.

## Deliverables:

- A working Python script implementing the optimized `ModelNew`.
