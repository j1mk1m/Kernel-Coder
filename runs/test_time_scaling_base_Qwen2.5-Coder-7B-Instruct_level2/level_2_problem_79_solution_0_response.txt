Note: You should aim to optimize the operations that can benefit most from GPU acceleration, such as convolutions, matrix multiplications, and large-scale tensor operations. Feel free to use any optimization techniques, such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or parallelization strategies. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible performance on the GPU.
