The code should be able to handle the same inputs as the original Model class. Make sure that the functionality remains the same, but the performance has been improved through the use of custom CUDA operators.

## Note:
- The optimization does not need to target all operators within the architecture. Feel free to optimize any subset of the operators.
- Consider operator fusion opportunities and algorithmic changes to achieve better performance.
