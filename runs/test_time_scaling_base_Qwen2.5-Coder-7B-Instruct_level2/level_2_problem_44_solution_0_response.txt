Your solution should include the definition of `ModelNew` class, the necessary imports, and any additional helper functions or classes needed. Make sure all CUDA operations are correctly implemented and the overall functionality remains the same as the original `Model`. 

Please note that the goal is to achieve significant performance improvements through the use of custom CUDA kernels. Consider optimizing both memory access patterns and parallelization strategies.

```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    # Your implementation here
```
