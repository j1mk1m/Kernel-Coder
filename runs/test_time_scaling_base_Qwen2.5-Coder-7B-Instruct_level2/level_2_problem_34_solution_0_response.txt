### Note:
You should aim to optimize the performance of the `forward` method by replacing certain PyTorch operators with custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to combine multiple operations into a single kernel or use more efficient algorithms where possible. However, ensure that the resulting code remains easy to understand and maintain.
