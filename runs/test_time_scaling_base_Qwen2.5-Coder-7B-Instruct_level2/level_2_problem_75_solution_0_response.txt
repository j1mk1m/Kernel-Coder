Please note that it's fine to use multiple custom CUDA kernels within the same file, but ensure each kernel has a unique function name.

### Constraints:
- Your solution must be written in Python using PyTorch.
- Ensure that all operations are correctly replaced with their CUDA implementations.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and focus on optimizing performance where possible.
- Use appropriate CUDA programming techniques such as shared memory, coalesced memory access, etc., to further optimize the kernels.
- Make sure the output architecture `ModelNew` maintains the same functionality as the original `Model`.

### Example:
For instance, replacing the linear layer with a custom CUDA kernel for matrix multiplication would look something like:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the custom CUDA kernel for GEMM
gemm_source = """
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void gemm_kernel(const float* A, const float* B, float* C, int M, int N, int K) {
    // Kernel implementation here
}

torch::Tensor gemm_cuda(torch::Tensor A, torch::Tensor B) {
    // Launch kernel and return result
}
"""

# Compile the inline CUDA code for GEMM
gemm = load_inline(
    name="gemm",
    cpp_sources="torch::Tensor gemm_cuda(torch::Tensor A, torch::Tensor B);",
    cuda_sources=gemm_source,
    functions=["gemm_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, num_groups, bias_shape):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.gemm = gemm

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.gemm.gemm_cuda(x, weight)
        # Rest of the forward pass remains the same
```
