Please optimize the architecture using any techniques described above, but please ensure that you provide enough detail so that someone else could reproduce your results. Your solution should be efficient and maintainable. 

Here is one possible approach:

- Replace the `nn.Conv3d` operator with a custom CUDA kernel that performs the same operation but in parallel.
- Replace the division by a constant with a multiplication by its reciprocal, which can be done more efficiently on the GPU.
- Replace the `nn.MaxPool3d` and `nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d` operators with custom CUDA kernels that perform these operations in parallel.
- Replace the `torch.sum` operation with a custom CUDA kernel that performs the summation in parallel.

Make sure to provide detailed explanations of your choices and how they contribute to the efficiency of the optimized architecture.
