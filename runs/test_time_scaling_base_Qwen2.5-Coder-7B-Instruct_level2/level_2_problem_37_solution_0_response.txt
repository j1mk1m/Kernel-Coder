Please note that you can use any libraries you need, such as `torch`, `torchvision`, `numpy` etc.

Your solution should aim to achieve significant speedup over the original PyTorch implementation. To measure the speedup, you can compare the execution time of the original and optimized models using the provided `get_inputs()` function. Use the `timeit` module to measure the execution time. For example:

```python
import timeit

model = Model(*get_init_inputs()).to("cuda")
inputs = get_inputs()[0].to("cuda")

original_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: model(inputs), number=100)
print(f"Original time: {original_time} seconds")

model_new = ModelNew(*get_init_inputs()).to("cuda")
inputs = get_inputs()[0].to("cuda")

new_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: model_new(inputs), number=100)
print(f"New time: {new_time} seconds")
```

This will give you an idea of how much faster the optimized model is compared to the original model. Your goal is to reduce the execution time significantly, ideally by at least an order of magnitude.
