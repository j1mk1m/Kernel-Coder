### Constraints:
- You must use CUDA for acceleration.
- You can replace any number of operations with custom CUDA kernels.
- You can fuse multiple operations into a single kernel.
- You cannot change the API signature of the `forward` method.

### Example:
If you decide to replace the matrix multiplication (`torch.matmul`) with a custom CUDA kernel, you would need to implement the CUDA kernel and then call it from within the `ModelNew` class. Make sure to handle memory allocation and deallocation correctly.
