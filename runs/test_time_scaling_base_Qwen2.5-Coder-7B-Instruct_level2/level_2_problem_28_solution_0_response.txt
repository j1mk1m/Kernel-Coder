Please ensure the outputted code does not contain any errors or typos. It should be syntactically correct and functionally equivalent to the original Model class.

Note: You can use PyTorch's C++ extension API to create custom CUDA operators. Be aware that creating custom CUDA operators requires knowledge of both PyTorch and CUDA programming. If you are not familiar with these topics, I recommend reading the PyTorch C++ Extension Guide and the CUDA Programming Guide before proceeding.
