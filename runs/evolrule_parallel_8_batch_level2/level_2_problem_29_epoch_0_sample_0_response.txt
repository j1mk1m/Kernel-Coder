The goal is to make the architecture run faster. You can replace any of the operators in the forward function, e.g. the linear layer (matmul), the mish activation, or the combination of the two. You can also use operator fusion (combining multiple operations into a single kernel). The example shows how to replace a simple addition with a custom CUDA kernel. You can also replace multiple operators with custom CUDA kernels. 

**Note**: Mish is a relatively new activation function, defined as mish(x) = x * tanh(softplus(x)). It can be approximated by x * tanh(ln(1 + e^x)) or similar formulations. Implementing it efficiently in CUDA might require approximations or optimizations. 

The problem is to generate the optimized code. The user will then run the code to test for speedups. 

I want you to write code for ModelNew that uses custom CUDA kernels to accelerate the original architecture. 

I want you to also take into consideration the following points:
- Try to fuse as many operations as possible into a single CUDA kernel. For example, fusing the linear layer (matrix multiplication) with the mish activation, then the next mish activation into one kernel. Fusing operations reduces memory bandwidth usage and kernel launch overhead.
- Consider algorithmic optimizations for mish, such as approximating the mish function for faster computation, or using look-up tables, etc. 
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernels are properly vectorized and utilize CUDA thread blocks and grids efficiently. 
- The input tensors are of size (batch_size, in_features), with batch_size=1024 and in_features=8192, so you can take advantage of the tensor dimensions for optimization.
- You can choose to replace only parts of the architecture. For example, you might choose to only replace the linear layer with a custom CUDA kernel and leave the mish activations as is, or vice versa. However, it's better to try to fuse as much as possible for maximum speedup.

Please make sure your code is correct and functional. The code must import correctly, and the model can be initialized with the get_init_inputs() function. The inputs are generated by get_inputs().
