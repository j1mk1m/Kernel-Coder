# This version uses half-precision (FP16) to leverage Tensor Cores and reduce memory usage. The kernel combines matrix multiplication, GELU activation, and softmax in a single step. However, implementing the full Tensor Core-based matrix multiplication requires careful handling of matrix partitions, thread synchronization, and shared memory management. This implementation serves as a template, and the actual kernel would need to be carefully developed and tuned for optimal performance.
