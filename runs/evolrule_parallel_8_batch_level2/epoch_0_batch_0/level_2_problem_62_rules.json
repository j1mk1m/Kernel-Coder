  "The kernel misses the fully connected layer (matrix multiplication) computation, only handling subsequent steps like group norm or activation.",
  "The kernel incorrectly calculates group mean and variance using per-thread computations without proper reduction across all elements in the group.",
  "The kernel uses sequential PyTorch operations instead of a fused CUDA kernel, increasing kernel launch overhead and memory traffic."
