["The kernel fuses bias addition, element-wise division, and Swish activation into a single CUDA kernel to reduce memory accesses.",
"The kernel uses scalar parameters for bias and division to avoid unnecessary memory lookups.",
"The kernel avoids using cuBLAS for matrix multiplication to retain control over operation fusion sequence."]
