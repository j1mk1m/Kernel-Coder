The correct and fastest solution is the **First Solution** with a runtime of **29.1 milliseconds**. It achieves the required computation by fusing the scaling and residual addition into a single kernel, eliminating redundant operations and minimizing memory transfers. The Fourth Solution, though conceptually similar, is marked as incorrect or untested due to potential implementation issues (e.g., indexing errors or device mismatches). The First Solution leverages the optimized PyTorch `nn.Linear` layer for matrix multiplication and applies the adjusted scaling factor efficiently, ensuring correctness and performance.

\boxed{\text{The first solution is correct and fastest with runtime 29.1}}
