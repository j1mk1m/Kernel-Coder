  "The kernel fuses convolution with multiple activation functions and bias into a single operation to reduce kernel launches.",
  "The kernel implements activation functions without branching (e.g., using fmax/fmin) to optimize performance.",
  "The kernel calculates output dimensions dynamically based on input tensor shapes to ensure correctness."
