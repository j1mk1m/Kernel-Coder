  "The kernel uses parallel reduction with warp shuffle instructions (e.g., __shfl_down_sync) to optimize reduction steps.",
  "The kernel correctly implements the log-sum-exp operation by subtracting the maximum value before exponentiation to prevent overflow.",
  "The kernel avoids incorrect bias terms when none exist in the original PyTorch layer."
