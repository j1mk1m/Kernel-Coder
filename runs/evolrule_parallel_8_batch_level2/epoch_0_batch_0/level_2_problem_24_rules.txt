The analysis of the CUDA kernels reveals two potential candidates that could be considered correct with modifications. 

1. **First Kernel (Fused Kernel with Constants):** While hard-coded constants limit its flexibility, the kernel structure for fusing operations is valid but restricted to specific input sizes. 
2. **Second Solution (Separate Conv3D and Min+Softmax):** The split into two kernels allows some fusion and avoids redundancy. The flawed min+softmax implementation could be fixed with corrections to indexing and loops.

Both solutions show foundational attempts to fuse operations, making them potentially correctable, hence two are deemed correct with adjustments.

\boxed{2}
