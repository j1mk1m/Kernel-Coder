- **Incorrect Solutions:** Any kernel misplacing operations (e.g., `clamp` after the second multiply) or miscalculating memory indices would fail.

### Rule-Like Statements from the CUDA Solution:
```json
[
  "The kernel fuses clamp and multiplication into a single step.",
  "The kernel uses thread indices to iterate over all dimensions deterministically.",
  "The kernel combines max reduction over channels into one pass."
]
```
