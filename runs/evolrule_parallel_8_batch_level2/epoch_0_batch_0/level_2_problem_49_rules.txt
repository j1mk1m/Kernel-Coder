Now, extracting the rule-like statements from this analysis:

1. **The kernel uses shared memory for parallel reduction of summation in Softmax.** (This was done in the first solution to avoid sequential loops)
2. **The kernel ensures the activation functions (Softmax followed by Sigmoid) are applied in the correct sequential order.** (The first solution correctly applied Sigmoid after Softmax, whereas others did not)
3. **The kernel employs a grid and block configuration optimized for the 5D input tensor dimensions (batch, channels, D, H, W).** (The correct kernel handles 5D tensors correctly, unlike others that used 4D)

However, looking at the examples given (operator fusion, shared memory tiling, thread block size multiples of warp size), maybe other patterns are more precise.

Wait the user's examples are like:
- Operator fusion between multiple operations.
- Shared memory tiling for reduced global access.
- Thread block sizes are multiples of warp size (32)

Looking back at the correct solution:
- It does **operator fusion** (Softmax and Sigmoid in a single kernel).
- It uses **shared memory reduction** (shared_data array) for the Softmax sum.
- The block size equals the number of channels (64). Since 64 is a multiple of the warp size (32), this aligns with example 3.

Thus, the three rules are:

1. The kernel performs operator fusion between multiple operations (Softmax and Sigmoid).
2. The kernel uses shared memory reduction to minimize global memory accesses.
3. The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of the warp size (32) (since 64 is 2×32).

Thus, these three rules can be derived from the analysis of the first solution.
[Reasoning]

The first kernel effectively fuses Softmax and Sigmoid into a single kernel, reducing memory transfers and execution overhead. It uses shared memory to compute the Softmax denominator efficiently in parallel (shared memory reduction). Additionally, it uses a block size of 64 (a multiple of the warp size of 32), ensuring optimal thread utilization and hardware efficiency. These points directly align with the provided examples of rule-like statements.
