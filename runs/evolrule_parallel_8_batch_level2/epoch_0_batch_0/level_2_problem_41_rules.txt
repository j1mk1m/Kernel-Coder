  "The kernel uses PyTorch's nn.Linear for GEMM to leverage optimized matrix multiplication.",
  "The kernel fuses BatchNorm, GELU, and ReLU into a single kernel to reduce memory access overhead.",
  "The kernel implements the GELU function using the tanh-based approximation to match PyTorch's default implementation."
