### Rationale for the rules:
1. **Missing FC Layer** - Many kernels omit the initial FC computation, which invalidates correctness (critical for task input/output structure)
2. **Improper Reduction for GroupNorm** - Flawed mean/variance calculation was the primary correctness issue in proposed solutions
3. **Sequential Operations Overhead** - Splitting computations into separate PyTorch steps introduces unnecessary overhead compared to a single fused kernel

The rules are general enough to apply to different kernels while capturing key issues from the analysis. They focus on objective design choices (missing components, calculation logic flaws, and implementation approach). The top 3 issues across all kernel variants are captured here. No other unique rule-like patterns emerge from the analysis of provided examples. Each of these rules can be tested objectively (e.g., check if FC is present, inspect reduction implementation, count kernel launches). 

Three is the maximum allowed, and these represent the most significant systemic flaws across the provided solutions. The other issues mentioned (like incorrect parameter handling) are specific instances of these broader principles. For example, mixing FC bias and GroupNorm parameters falls under "incorrect group norm calculations" since it results in invalid gamma/beta applications. The 2x scale factor replacement is acceptable, so it doesn't qualify for a rule as it's mathematically equivalent. The "scale" implementation isn't incorrect. The main issues are captured in the three listed rules.### Final Answer
