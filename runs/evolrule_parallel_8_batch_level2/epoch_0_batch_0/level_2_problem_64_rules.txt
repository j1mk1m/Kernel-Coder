- **Common Pitfalls** in CUDA kernels include:
  - Forgetting to align reductions with block/thread dimensions.
  - Not leveraging parallel reductions with CUB or custom logic.
  - Ignoring the GPU’s memory hierarchy (global vs. shared).

If you'd like to dive deeper into a specific aspect (e.g., how to fuse Gemm with logsumexp), I can provide code examples!
