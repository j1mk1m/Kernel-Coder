["The kernel uses a block size of 256 for optimal GPU core utilization.",
"The kernel applies a polynomial approximation of GELU using precomputed constants for speed.",
"The kernel reduces global memory access by fusing division and GELU operations into a single step."]


["The kernel uses thread block sizes that are powers of two (e.g., 256) for optimal warp scheduling.",
"The kernel avoids redundant mathematical computations (e.g., uses precomputed constants like 0.79788456f instead of sqrt(2/pi)).",
"The kernel fuses consecutive operations (division and GELU) into a single kernel to minimize data transfers."]
