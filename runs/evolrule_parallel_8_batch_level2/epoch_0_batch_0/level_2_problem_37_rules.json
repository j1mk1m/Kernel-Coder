  "The kernel uses a fused CUDA kernel for Swish activation followed by bias addition.",
  "The kernel correctly separates matrix multiplication bias and post-Swish bias parameters.",
  "The kernel avoids nested loops over input dimensions for matrix multiplication, leveraging thread-wise parallelism."
