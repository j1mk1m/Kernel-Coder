  "The kernel uses a fused CUDA kernel to combine clamp and division, reducing memory transfers.",
  "The kernel precomputes the reciprocal of the divisor for faster multiplication instead of division.",
  "The kernel avoids reimplementation of transposed convolution, relying on PyTorch's optimized implementation."
