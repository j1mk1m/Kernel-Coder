  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).",
  "The kernel fuses multiple activation functions (Swish, Tanh, GELU, Hardtanh) into a single kernel launch.",
  "The kernel implements GELU using an exact erf-based calculation instead of the standard tanh approximation."
