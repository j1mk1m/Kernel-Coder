### Explanation of the Rules
1. **Fused CUDA Kernel:** 
   - Combining all post-processing steps (bias addition, clamping, scaling) into one kernel eliminates multiple kernel launches and intermediate memory copies. This reduces overhead and maximizes throughput.
   
2. **Optimization Flags (-O3):** 
   - Enabling compiler optimizations (`-O3`) allows the NVCC compiler to improve loop unrolling, code scheduling, and arithmetic intensity, leading to faster execution.

3. **Same CUDA Device:** 
   - Ensuring tensors and kernels are on the same device (CUDA) avoids CPU-GPU data transfers and synchronization issues, critical for CUDA-based processing correctness and speed.

These rules generalize to other CUDA kernels by emphasizing fusion of operations, compilation optimizations, and proper device management.```json
