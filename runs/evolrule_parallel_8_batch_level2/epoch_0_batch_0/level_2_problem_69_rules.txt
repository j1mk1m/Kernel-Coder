  "The kernel uses branch-based calculations (if-else) for different input ranges to reduce arithmetic operations.",
  "The kernel avoids intermediate clamping steps (e.g., fmax/fmin) by directly computing output for defined value ranges.",
  "The kernel explicitly combines Hardswish and ReLU activation logic into a single computational step."
