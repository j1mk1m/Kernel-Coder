  "The kernel uses PyTorch's optimized Linear layer for matrix multiplication to ensure efficient computation.",
  "The kernel employs parallel reduction using shared memory to efficiently sum over features.",
  "The kernel eliminates redundant operations (max, mean, logsumexp) by recognizing they have no effect on the scalar output."
