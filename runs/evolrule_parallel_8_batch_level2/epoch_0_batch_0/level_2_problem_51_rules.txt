  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are not multiples of the warp size (32), causing inefficient execution.",
  "The kernel performs matrix multiplication with nested loops inside a single thread, leading to high computational cost and poor parallelism.",
  "The kernel does not ensure all tensors are on the same CUDA device, leading to runtime errors due to device mismatches."
