  
The user's attempts failed due to missing steps (scaling, affine transformation), inefficient memory access patterns, and potentially incorrect reduction logic, leading to both performance bottlenecks and incorrect results.


["The kernel processes raw GEMM output instead of applying the learned scaling parameter first.", "The kernel uses column-major memory access pattern leading to uncoalesced global memory accesses.", "The kernel does not apply learned affine parameters (gamma and beta) from the batch normalization layer."]
