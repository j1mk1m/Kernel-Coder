[Reasoning]
The analysis of the provided solutions revealed several key differences and potential rule-like statements. 

1. **Shared Memory Usage for Softmax Reduction**:
   - Solution 4 attempts to use shared memory to store intermediate values for softmax, but incorrect indexing prevents it from correctly computing across all channels.
   - A proper implementation requires shared memory storage of all channel values for a spatial position (b, h, w), allowing synchronized reduction for max and sum calculations.

2. **Thread Block Size Compliance**:
   - Solution 3 uses thread blocks with 128×128 threads (H×W), which exceeds CUDA's limit of 1024 threads per block, leading to a kernel launch failure.
   - Thread block sizes must be chosen such that the total number of threads per block (blockDim.x * blockDim.y * blockDim.z) ≤ 1024.

3. **Bias Tensor Indexing**:
   - Multiple solutions (Solution 1 and others) incorrectly use spatial dimensions (h, w) when accessing the bias tensor, which only has a channel dimension and singleton spatial dimensions.
   - The correct bias access pattern should only involve the channel index `c`, not spatial dimensions.

These points form the basis for rule-like statements to capture the observed differences.

The key points from the analysis indicate that proper kernel design requires efficient shared memory usage for reductions, adherence to thread block limits, and correct bias tensor indexing. These rules can be applied to evaluate or design other CUDA kernels similarly. The three rules are:
1. Shared memory for reductions (softmax)
2. Thread block size under 1024
3. Bias indexing without spatial dims
The rule-like statements based on the analysis are as follows:
The key points from the analysis include the use of shared memory for reductions (like softmax), thread block size limits, and proper indexing of the bias tensor. These form objective, generalizable rules for CUDA kernels.

  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that do not exceed CUDA's maximum limit of 1024 threads per block.",
  "The kernel accesses the bias tensor using only the channel index, not spatial dimensions."
]

These rules highlight fundamental aspects identified in the analysis:
1. **Shared Memory for Reductions**: Properly managing memory for cross-channel operations (like softmax) to ensure correctness.
2. **Thread Block Limits**: Ensuring thread counts comply with hardware constraints.
3. **Correct Bias Indexing**: Avoiding spatial indexing for bias which lacks spatial dimensions beyond 1. 

These are general and objectively checkable, making them suitable for evaluating kernel designs.

  "The kernel accesses the bias tensor using only the channel index, not spatial dimensions."
]
```The analysis of the solutions highlighted three key rule-like statements that distinguish correct implementations:

1. **Shared Memory for Cross-Channel Reductions**: Kernels must store intermediate values (e.g., for softmax) in shared memory to enable reductions across channels efficiently.
2. **Thread Block Size Compliance**: Thread blocks must adhere to CUDA's limit of ≤1024 threads per block to avoid launch failures.
3. **Bias Indexing Without Spatial Dimensions**: The bias tensor (with shape (1, C, 1, 1, 1)) must be accessed using only the channel index `c`, excluding spatial dimensions `h`/`w`.

These rules are objectively measurable and applicable broadly to CUDA kernel design.

```The three rule-like statements extracted are those that directly address the observed issues in the solutions:

1. **Shared Memory for Cross-Channel Reductions**: Important for correctness in operations like softmax, which require reductions over channels.
2. **Thread Block Size Limit**: Ensures kernels do not violate CUDA hardware constraints, leading to launch failures.
3. **Bias Indexing Correctness**: Avoids index mismatches with the bias tensor's structure.

These rules can be objectively checked and applied to different kernels.
