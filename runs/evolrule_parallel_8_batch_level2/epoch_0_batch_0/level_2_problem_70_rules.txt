The other kernels are either incorrect due to Gemm implementation issues or too slow because they either re-implement Gemm manually or fuse inefficiently.


["The kernel uses PyTorch's built-in nn.Linear for matrix multiplication (Gemm) to leverage optimized cuBLAS implementation.", "The kernel fuses element-wise operations (sigmoid, scaling, residual add) into a single CUDA kernel to reduce overhead from multiple launches.", "The kernel avoids manual matrix multiplication implementation to prevent inefficiencies from naive CUDA Gemm." ]
