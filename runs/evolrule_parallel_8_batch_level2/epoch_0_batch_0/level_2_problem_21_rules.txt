  "The kernel fuses only element-wise operations (bias, scaling, and sigmoid) while retaining PyTorch's optimized Conv2d and GroupNorm implementations.",
  "The kernel uses a block size of 256 threads to leverage GPU parallelism efficiently.",
  "The kernel uses flattened indices and contiguous memory access to maximize memory coalescing and cache efficiency."
