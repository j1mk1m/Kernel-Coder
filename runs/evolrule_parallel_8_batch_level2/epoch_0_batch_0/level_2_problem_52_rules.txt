  "The kernel uses branchless implementation to avoid thread divergence",
  "The kernel applies mathematical approximation for extreme values (e.g., x > 20 or x < -20) to reduce computational overhead",
  "The kernel uses numerically stable computation (e.g., log1pf and expf) to prevent overflow/underflow"
