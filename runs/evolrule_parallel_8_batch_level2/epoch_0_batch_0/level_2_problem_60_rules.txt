  "- The kernel replaces default PyTorch activations (Swish/HardSwish) with custom CUDA implementations for faster parallel execution.",
  "- The kernel uses thread coalescing and single-pass operations to minimize memory access overhead for element-wise computations.",
  "- The kernel retains PyTorch layers like ConvTranspose3d and GroupNorm while optimizing only the slowest operations."
