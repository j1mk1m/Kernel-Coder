The kernel performs operator fusion between the Swish activation and scaling operation.  
The kernel uses PyTorch's built-in Linear layer for matrix multiplication instead of implementing it manually.  
The kernel ensures all tensors are moved to the CUDA device before execution.  

These rules capture key points from the analysis:
1. Operator fusion between Swish and scaling is highlighted in correct solutions (Eval: True) while incorrect solutions often mishandled fusion scope.
2. Relying on PyTorch's optimized Linear layer was critical for performance, unlike manual matrix multiplication attempts that caused slowdowns.
3. Device mismatches (CPU vs. CUDA tensors) were a failure point in some incorrect solutions.  

Maximum 3 rules as requested.  
```json
[
  "The kernel performs operator fusion between the Swish activation and scaling operation.",
  "The kernel uses PyTorch's built-in Linear layer for matrix multiplication instead of implementing it manually.",
  "The kernel ensures all tensors are moved to the CUDA device before execution."
]
``` To determine the rule-like statements from the provided analysis, we focus on the key differences between correct and incorrect kernel implementations:

1. **Operator Fusion**: The successful kernels fuse Swish and scaling, reducing memory traffic and improving efficiency. Incorrect kernels often fused matrix multiplication and activation steps ineffectively or omitted fusion entirely.

2. **Use of PyTorch’s Optimized Layers**: Correct solutions leveraged PyTorch’s `Linear` layer for matrix multiplication, which is optimized with Tensor Cores. Incorrect solutions tried manual matrix multiplication, leading to inefficiency.

3. **Device Consistency**: Valid kernels ensured all tensors were on the CUDA device. Failing solutions had tensors created on CPU, causing errors.

These three rules encapsulate the critical factors for correctness and performance identified in the analysis.  
```json

  "The kernel performs operator fusion between the Swish activation and scaling operation.",
  "The kernel uses PyTorch's built-in Linear layer for matrix multiplication instead of implementing it manually.",
  "The kernel ensures all tensors are moved to the CUDA device before execution."
]
```  

Final check confirms these rules are objective, deterministic, and generalizable to other CUDA kernels.

``` [Answer]
["The kernel performs operator fusion between the Swish activation and scaling operation.", "The kernel uses PyTorch's built-in Linear layer for matrix multiplication instead of implementing it manually.", "The kernel ensures all tensors are moved to the CUDA device before execution."]
```json
[
  "The kernel performs operator fusion between the Swish activation and scaling operation.",
  "The kernel uses PyTorch's built-in Linear layer for matrix multiplication instead of implementing it manually.",
  "The kernel ensures all tensors are moved to the CUDA device before execution."
]
``` The problem requires extracting rule-like statements from the analysis provided. The correct answers focus on three main points observed in the evaluation of different CUDA kernels:

1. **Operator Fusion**: The analysis emphasizes that kernels which correctly fused Swish activation and scaling were evaluated as true and were efficient. This is a key difference between successful and incorrect implementations.

2. **Avoiding Manual Matrix Multiplication**: The comparison showed that kernels relying on PyTorch's optimized Linear layer for matrix multiplication performed better. Incorrect solutions that manually implemented matrix multiplication were slower or had errors.

3. **Device Consistency**: The successful kernels ensured tensors were on the CUDA device, while failing solutions had device mismatches (e.g., tensors on CPU), leading to errors.

These points translate directly to the three rules listed in the answer. Each rule is objective, determinable, and generalizable beyond the specific kernels discussed. The analysis clearly differentiates these practices between correct and incorrect implementations, validating their inclusion.
