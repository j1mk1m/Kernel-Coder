  "The kernel fuses multiple operations (matrix multiplication, max pooling, summation, and scaling) into a single CUDA kernel to reduce intermediate memory copies.",
  "The kernel uses a thread block size of 256 to better utilize GPU resources compared to smaller thread block sizes.",
  "The kernel processes feature dimensions in steps of the kernel size (e.g., 2) to efficiently implement max pooling without intermediate tensors."
