  "The kernel uses shared memory to store intermediate values for cross-channel reductions (e.g., softmax computation).",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that do not exceed CUDA's maximum limit of 1024 threads per block.",
  "The kernel accesses the bias tensor using only the channel index, not spatial dimensions."
