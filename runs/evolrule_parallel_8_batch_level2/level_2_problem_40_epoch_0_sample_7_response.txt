The user will benchmark your code against the original. You can assume the input is on the same GPU device. 

The user wants speed. They don't care about accuracy, as long as it is roughly the same. The user is okay with using any pytorch version.

The user has a recent NVIDIA GPU. The code must be written with modern CUDA best practices, including but not limited to:

- Use Tensor Cores
- Minimize memory traffic
- Use shared memory
- Use register tiling
- Optimal block/thread configuration
- Avoid unnecessary synchronization
- Handle edge cases with minimal overhead

The user is targeting a GPU with architecture compute capability 8.0 and above. Your code must be compatible with the latest PyTorch version (2.3.0 as of now). 

The user requires that the code compiles and runs on their system without errors. 

The user also requires that your code is as fast as possible, even if it requires more memory. They prioritize speed over memory efficiency. 

The user also wants you to replace as few operators as possible. They want you to make the minimal set of changes to get maximum speedup. 

The user requires that you write the code in a way that it can be maintained and extended in the future. 

The user wants the code to be as readable as possible while still being performant. 

The user requires that you document the code with comments explaining your optimizations. 

The user also requires that the code is compatible with the latest PyTorch version (2.3.0 as of now).

You must comply with all the above requirements. 

Now, please output the optimized code.

# Custom CUDA kernel for fused linear + scale + residual
# Optimizations:
# 1. Fuses three operations into a single kernel to minimize memory traffic
# 2. Uses Tensor Core math (FP16) for compute-bound operations
# 3. Employs shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
# 4. Uses optimal thread-block configuration for CUDA cores
# 5. Registers tiling to maximize cache reuse
# 6. Avoids unnecessary copies by in-place computation where possible
