This optimized implementation replaces the sequential Mish and Tanh activations with a fused CUDA kernel that performs both operations in a single pass. This reduces memory bandwidth usage and kernel launch overhead while maintaining numerical accuracy. The 3D convolution remains unchanged as optimizing it would require a more complex implementation beyond the scope of this example.
