The following constraints apply: 

- You can only replace PyTorch operators with your own CUDA kernels. You can choose to replace any subset of the operators (or none). You may also combine multiple operators into a single kernel. 
- The replacement kernels must be written as inlined CUDA extensions. Use the torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline method as in the example. 
- The new architecture must have the same external interface as the original. The ModelNew class must have the same __init__ signature as the original Model. 
- You are encouraged to replace as many operators as possible for maximum speedup. However, you must generate code that actually works. 
- You may not use any third-party libraries or dependencies outside of PyTorch. 

Now, please output the optimized ModelNew class with any inline CUDA kernels required. Make sure the code is correct and runs without errors.

The optimized ModelNew class replaces the combination of batch normalization and mean subtraction with a fused CUDA kernel to reduce memory traffic and eliminate intermediate tensor allocations. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Kernel Fusion**: The batch normalization and mean subtraction operations are combined into a single CUDA kernel. This avoids the need to store intermediate normalized values in memory before computing the mean.

2. **Efficient Mean Calculation**: The spatial mean is calculated within the kernel using shared memory and parallel reduction, eliminating the need for an additional kernel launch or CPU involvement.

3. **Parameter Handling**: The kernel accepts batch normalization parameters (running mean, variance, weight, bias) as inputs, allowing it to perform the normalization step inline.

4. **Memory Efficiency**: By fusing operations, we reduce the number of kernel launches and memory transfers between CPU and GPU, which is a significant performance bottleneck.

5. **Template Specialization**: The kernel uses ATen's dispatch system to handle different floating-point types (float, half, etc.) without code duplication.

6. **Thread Block Design**: The kernel uses a 256-thread block size with shared memory for reduction steps to maximize occupancy and minimize synchronization overhead.

7. **Contiguous Tensors**: The forward method ensures all input tensors are contiguous to guarantee coalesced memory access patterns, which is critical for optimal CUDA performance.

This implementation maintains the original model's behavior while significantly improving performance through kernel fusion and optimized memory access patterns.
