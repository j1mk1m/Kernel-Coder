Additionally, explain the optimizations you made in English. 

Your explanation should include the following points: 

- For each operator that you replaced, explain why you replaced it and the optimization you made.
- For each operator that you fused, explain the benefit of the fusion.
- For each algorithmic change you made, explain the benefit.
- If you left any operator unchanged, explain why you chose not to replace it.
- Explain how the fused operators are implemented in the kernel and how they are called.
- What is the expected performance improvement compared to the original model? (e.g. "I expect a 2x speedup because ...")
- What is the memory saving compared to the original model? (e.g. "I expect a 50% memory saving because ...")

Your answer should be concise and to the point. Do not add any extra information not related to the above questions.

**Explanation:**
- **Fusion of Gemm, Divide, Sum, and Scaling:** 
  - Replaced all four operators with a single fused kernel. This eliminates intermediate tensors (e.g., after Gemm and Divide), reducing memory usage and avoiding data transfers between CPU/GPU.
  - The kernel computes the matrix multiplication (Gemm), divides by 2, accumulates the sum across input_size, and applies scaling in a single pass, reducing arithmetic operations and memory accesses.

- **Algorithmic Optimization:**
  - The fused kernel combines all operations into one loop, reducing loop overhead and divergence. The sum is computed directly during the Gemm iteration, avoiding a separate reduction step.

- **Memory Saving:**
  - Original model required intermediate tensors for Gemm output (~1024x8192), Divide result (same size), and Sum output (1024x1). The fused kernel eliminates the first two, saving ~1024*8192*2 ≈ 16.7MB.

- **Performance Improvement:**
  - Expected ~3x speedup over original due to:
    1. Reduced memory bandwidth usage (half the reads/writes).
    2. Elimination of kernel launches (4→1).
    3. Loop fusion reduces arithmetic instructions (e.g., division is applied immediately after multiplication).

- **Unchanged Elements:** None. All operations were fused into the kernel.
