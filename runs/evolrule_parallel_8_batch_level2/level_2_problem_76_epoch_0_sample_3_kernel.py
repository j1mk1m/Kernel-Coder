Please determine whether the user is asking for a fused kernel that combines all three operations (GEMM, bias addition, and ReLU) into a single kernel. The initial code example provided by the user shows how to replace an addition with a custom kernel, but the second code block in the "imaginary thought process" fused all three operations into one kernel. The user might have intended the second approach for better performance by eliminating multiple kernel launches and memory transfers. However, the first approach is simpler and might still provide a measurable speedup. The optimal solution would depend on the specific hardware and input sizes, but fusing all operations could offer the best performance.


The optimized architecture named `ModelNew` is provided below. This implementation fuses the **matrix multiplication (GEMM), bias addition, and ReLU activation** into a single CUDA kernel for maximum performance. This approach reduces memory transfers, eliminates intermediate tensors, and minimizes kernel launch overhead.
