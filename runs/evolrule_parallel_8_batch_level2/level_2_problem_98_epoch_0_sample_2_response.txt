Please make sure that all the input and output dimensions are consistent and that the code is compatible with the original code's API. 

        Please also note that the original model may have multiple operators in a sequence, and you can choose to fuse some of them into a single CUDA kernel for better performance. For example, in the given example, the matmul and avg_pool can be fused into one kernel to reduce memory access. 

        You can also choose to replace individual operators with custom CUDA kernels. For example, you can replace the avg_pool with a custom CUDA kernel that is more optimized for your specific use case. You can also choose to implement the GELU activation function in a custom CUDA kernel for better performance. 

        When you are fusing multiple operators into a single kernel, you must ensure that the computation is correct. For example, if you fuse the matmul and avg_pool, you must ensure that the output of the fused kernel is the same as the output of the original two operators. 

        You can also choose to implement algorithmic changes. For example, you can replace the GELU activation function with a faster approximation. 

        You can also choose to replace multiple operators with custom CUDA kernels. For example, you can replace the matmul, avg_pool, and GELU with custom CUDA kernels. 

        You can also choose to replace the final max operation with a custom CUDA kernel. 

        You are encouraged to consider all possible optimizations. 

        Finally, after writing the custom CUDA kernels, you must ensure that the ModelNew class is compatible with the original Model class. That is, the input and output dimensions must be the same, and the parameters must be compatible. 

        The code you write must compile and run correctly. 

        The code must also be compatible with PyTorch's autograd system. 

        You can use any PyTorch extensions or CUDA libraries that are available in PyTorch. 

        You can also use any CUDA libraries or tools that are available in PyTorch's environment. 

        You can also use any CUDA features, such as dynamic parallelism, but be cautious about compatibility. 

        Please note that the code must be written in Python with inline CUDA kernels using the torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline function. 

        You can also write separate CUDA files and load them with load_inline, but inline is preferred for simplicity. 

        Please also note that the code must be written in a way that it can be run on any GPU architecture supported by PyTorch. 

        You can assume that the input tensors are on the GPU. 

        You can also assume that the model is trained on the GPU. 

        You can also assume that the model is run on a single GPU.
