Please ensure that the optimized kernel correctly implements the L2 normalization operation and achieves improved performance compared to the original PyTorch implementation.

Your latest generated kernel:

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```

```

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Ensure that the optimized kernel correctly implements the L2 normalization operation and achieves improved performance compared to the original PyTorch implementation. Address any issues from the previous evaluations and provide a final version of the architecture.

Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
