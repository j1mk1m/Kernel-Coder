Note: Feel free to add any additional imports or helper functions you need to achieve the optimization. 

Also note that since we're optimizing a transposed 2D convolution, the kernel will be asymmetric due to the different dimensions of the input and output. Make sure to handle this appropriately in your custom CUDA kernel.
