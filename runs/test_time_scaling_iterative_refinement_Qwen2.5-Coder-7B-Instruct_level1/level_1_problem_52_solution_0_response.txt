Please do not include any unnecessary comments unless they provide insight into your thought process. Your solution should be as clean and efficient as possible. 

Remember to use the provided `get_inputs` function to generate inputs for your model. Use the `get_init_inputs` function to generate any necessary initialization parameters. If you need to modify these functions, please ensure that they still produce valid inputs for your model. 

Ensure that your custom CUDA kernels are correctly integrated into your model and that the model still produces correct results. Verify that your implementation achieves the desired performance improvements compared to the original model.
