Note: You can use any libraries or packages available in PyTorch or standard Python libraries, but do not modify the function signatures or the `get_inputs` and `get_init_inputs` functions. Only change the architecture definition and add necessary imports at the beginning of your code. Ensure that the optimized architecture achieves better performance compared to the original one.
