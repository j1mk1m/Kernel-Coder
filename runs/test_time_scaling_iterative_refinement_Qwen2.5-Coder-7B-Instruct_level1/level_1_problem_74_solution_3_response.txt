Please note that I am looking for a solution that avoids using cuDNN, as it may limit certain optimizations. Also, ensure that the custom CUDA kernel correctly handles the transposed 1D convolution operation. 

Your latest generated kernel:
```
error: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel were evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
