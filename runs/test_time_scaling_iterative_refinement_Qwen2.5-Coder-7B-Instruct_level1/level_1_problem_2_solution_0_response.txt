Note: Feel free to modify any part of the code, including changing the architecture, adding new methods, or modifying existing ones. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible performance improvement while maintaining correctness. Consider algorithmic optimizations, operator fusion, and using efficient CUDA primitives where appropriate.
