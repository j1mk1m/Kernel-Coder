Please note that the optimization should be focused on speeding up the computation, so feel free to use any techniques you see fit, including but not limited to:

- Using CUDA for parallel computation.
- Implementing more efficient algorithms.
- Combining operations into a single kernel for better performance.
- Using specialized CUDA libraries or primitives where appropriate.
