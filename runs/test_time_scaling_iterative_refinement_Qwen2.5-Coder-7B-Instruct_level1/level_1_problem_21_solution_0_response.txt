Here is a list of PyTorch operators that could be considered for optimization:

- `torch.sigmoid` (can be replaced with a custom CUDA kernel for better performance)
- `torch.matmul` (can be fused with other operations like ReLU to create a single kernel)
- `torch.relu` (can be fused with matrix multiplication to create a single kernel)
- `torch.softmax` (can be replaced with a more efficient implementation)

Please optimize the architecture using these operators and provide the optimized code.
