Please provide detailed debug information if there were any errors or issues encountered during the optimization process.

The error message I am receiving is:

```
AttributeError: module 'torch.cuda' has no attribute 'cufftPlanMany'
```

It seems that the issue might be related to the CUDA version compatibility or missing dependencies. Could you please help me resolve this issue? Additionally, could you also suggest any improvements or optimizations to further enhance the performance of the custom CUDA kernel?
