No further optimization is possible without introducing additional complexity or altering the core functionality of the model. The current implementation already provides efficient execution of the SELU activation using a custom CUDA kernel. Any attempt to optimize further would likely result in diminishing returns or increased complexity without significant improvements in performance.

Therefore, the final optimized architecture `ModelNew` remains:
