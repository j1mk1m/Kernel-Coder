The solution should aim to optimize the cross entropy loss computation using CUDA kernels. Consider any possible optimizations such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or custom CUDA implementations. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible performance improvement while maintaining correctness. 

Please ensure that your implementation is correct and achieves the same results as the original PyTorch implementation. You can verify this by comparing the outputs of both implementations for the same inputs. 

Remember, the key to optimizing performance is understanding how PyTorch executes the operations and identifying bottlenecks that can be addressed with custom CUDA kernels.
