Please note that you can optimize any part of the architecture including but not limited to the convolution operation, activation function, memory access patterns, etc. Feel free to use any optimization techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, etc. The goal is to achieve maximum performance gain while maintaining the functionality of the original architecture. Your solution should be as efficient as possible without compromising the correctness of the results.
