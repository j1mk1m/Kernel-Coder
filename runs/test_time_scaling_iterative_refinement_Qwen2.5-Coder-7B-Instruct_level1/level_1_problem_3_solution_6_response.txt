Please note that the CUDA kernel should be able to handle larger matrices efficiently without causing memory access violations or running out of resources. Additionally, ensure that the kernel is correctly configured and launched to avoid any runtime errors. If necessary, adjust the thread and block dimensions, or use shared memory to optimize performance. ```
