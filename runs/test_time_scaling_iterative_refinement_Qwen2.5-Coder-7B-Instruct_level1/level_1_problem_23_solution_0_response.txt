Please ensure that the custom CUDA kernel is implemented correctly and efficiently. For the given architecture, consider using an efficient algorithm for computing the Softmax function. One possible approach is to use the log-sum-exp trick to avoid numerical instability. Additionally, you can parallelize the computation across threads or blocks to improve performance. Finally, ensure that the custom CUDA kernel is integrated seamlessly with the rest of the PyTorch framework. ```
