Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Ensure the kernel is correct and efficient. Debug any correctness issues or improve the efficiency if the kernel was correct.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code. 

Your latest generated kernel:
```
