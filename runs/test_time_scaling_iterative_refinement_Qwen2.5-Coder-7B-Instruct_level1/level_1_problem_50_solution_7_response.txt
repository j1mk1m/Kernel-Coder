Please note that your solution should be efficient both in terms of computational complexity and memory usage. Consider algorithmic optimizations as well as parallelism.

Your latest generated kernel:
```
'ModelNew' object has no attribute 'weight'
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
