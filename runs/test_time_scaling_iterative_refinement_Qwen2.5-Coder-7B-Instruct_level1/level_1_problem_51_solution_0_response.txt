Please include comments explaining your decisions in the code. Feel free to use any libraries from PyTorch, but do not import any external libraries outside of PyTorch. Use `load_inline` to compile the CUDA kernels. Make sure the code is self-contained and does not rely on external files or variables. 

The goal is to optimize the performance of the given architecture using custom CUDA operators. Your solution should aim to reduce the computational overhead and improve the execution speed of the model. 

Remember to explain your choices in terms of operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or other optimizations you've made. Feel free to experiment with different approaches and choose the one that provides the best performance improvement.
