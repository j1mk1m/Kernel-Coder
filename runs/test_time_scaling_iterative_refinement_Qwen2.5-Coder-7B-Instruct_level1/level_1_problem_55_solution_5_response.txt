Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Fix any syntax errors, logical issues, or performance improvements needed in your kernel. Ensure the architecture is both correct and efficient.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
