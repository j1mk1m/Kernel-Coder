The kernel appears to be correctly implemented and should work as expected. However, there might be an issue with the way the kernel is being compiled or linked. Please ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed and that the compilation process is successful. Additionally, check the environment variables and paths to ensure that the CUDA toolkit and other required libraries are properly configured.
