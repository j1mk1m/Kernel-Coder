Your latest generated kernel:
```
## Explanation

1. **Identify the Operation**: Recognize that the `softplus` operation is computationally intensive and can benefit from a custom CUDA implementation.
2. **Implement the Custom CUDA Kernel**: Write a CUDA kernel that computes the `softplus` function efficiently.
3. **Create a New Class**: Define a new class `ModelNew` that uses the custom CUDA kernel for the `forward` method.
4. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure that the new class produces the same results as the original `Model`.
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
