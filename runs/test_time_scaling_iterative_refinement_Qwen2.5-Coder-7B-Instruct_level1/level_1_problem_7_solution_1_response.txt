Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Debug any correctness issues and improve the efficiency of your previous attempt.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
