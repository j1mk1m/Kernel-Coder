Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```


Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Make sure your kernel is correctly implemented and debugged. If the kernel is incorrect, fix it and re-optimize the architecture.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
