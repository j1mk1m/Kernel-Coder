Your latest generated kernel:
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```


Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Make further improvements based on feedback from the previous evaluations. Ensure that the kernel is correctly implemented and the architecture works as expected. If there were any errors in the previous versions, fix them. Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Continuously improve until the kernel is correctly implemented and the architecture passes all checks. Make sure the final version is robust and efficient. Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
