Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:

```


Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Continuously improve the architecture until it matches the performance of the original architecture while being more efficient.

Name your final optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
