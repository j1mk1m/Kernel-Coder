### Hints:

- Consider replacing the average pooling operation with a more efficient implementation.
- Think about how you can leverage CUDA to parallelize the computation.
- If necessary, adjust the dimensions of the tensors to ensure compatibility with CUDA operations.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel handles edge cases correctly (e.g., when the input length is not divisible by the kernel size).
