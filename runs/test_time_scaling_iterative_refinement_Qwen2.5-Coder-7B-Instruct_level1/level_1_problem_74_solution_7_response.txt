Please note that I am looking for a solution that addresses the specific issues identified in my previous attempt and demonstrates improvements in both correctness and performance.

Your latest generated kernel:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel were evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Ensure that the generated code is correct, efficient, and properly handles edge cases such as varying batch sizes, input lengths, and different dilation values.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code. 

Please note that I am looking for a solution that meets all the specified requirements and addresses any issues that may arise during evaluation.
