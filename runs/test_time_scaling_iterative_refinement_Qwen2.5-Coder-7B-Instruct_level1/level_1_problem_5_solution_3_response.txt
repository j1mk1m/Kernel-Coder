Your latest generated kernel:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Please note that the provided evaluation result indicates there might be a syntax error in the kernel code. Let's debug and fix it. 

Let's try again:

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Ensure that the kernel code is syntactically correct and debug any issues related to syntax or logic. 
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
