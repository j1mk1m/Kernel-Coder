Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Please focus on optimizing the exclusive cumulative sum operation. If there are other operations that can be optimized, feel free to do so as well. However, prioritize the exclusive cumulative sum operation.

Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
