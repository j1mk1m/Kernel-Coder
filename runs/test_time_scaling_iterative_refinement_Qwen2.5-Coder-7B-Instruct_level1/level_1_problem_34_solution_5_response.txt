Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.

Please include any necessary imports at the beginning of the code and ensure that all dependencies are met. Also, provide clear documentation on how to compile and run the code.

Evaluation Result:
```
Invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
