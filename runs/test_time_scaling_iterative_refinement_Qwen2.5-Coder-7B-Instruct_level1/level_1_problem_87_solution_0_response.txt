Here's how you might approach optimizing the Model class:

- Consider whether there are any operations that can be fused together.
- Think about whether there are any algorithms that could be used instead of the default ones.
- Write the CUDA kernels for the custom operators.
- Integrate these kernels into the new architecture.
- Ensure that the new architecture still produces the same results as the original one.
