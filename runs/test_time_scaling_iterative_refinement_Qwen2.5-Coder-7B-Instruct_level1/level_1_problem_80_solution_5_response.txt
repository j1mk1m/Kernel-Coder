Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:

Please note that there might be several valid solutions to this problem. However, the solution should aim to optimize the performance of the 2D convolution operation using custom CUDA kernels while maintaining the same functionality as the original architecture.
