Please note that the optimization should focus on speeding up the RMS normalization operation. Feel free to use any technique that improves performance, such as fused operations, algorithmic changes, etc. 

Please ensure that the output architecture `ModelNew` maintains the same functionality as the original `Model`. The `forward` method should produce the same output for any valid input.
