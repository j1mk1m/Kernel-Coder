The goal is to achieve faster execution times for the forward pass of the model. Feel free to optimize any part of the model including but not limited to:

- Replacing the mean squared error calculation with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Combining multiple operations into a single CUDA kernel.
- Implementing alternative algorithms for mean squared error calculation.

Please provide the optimized code for ModelNew below.
