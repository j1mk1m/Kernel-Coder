Your custom CUDA kernel should be efficient and follow best practices for CUDA programming. Feel free to modify the architecture or add additional layers as needed to achieve better performance. 

Remember that you can use techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or other optimizations to improve performance. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible throughput for the given model.
