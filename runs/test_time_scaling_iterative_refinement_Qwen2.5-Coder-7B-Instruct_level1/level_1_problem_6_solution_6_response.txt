Improve upon your previous attempts by debugging any correctness issues or improving the efficiency if the kernel was correct.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code. 

Make sure to follow these guidelines:
- Your implementation should be able to handle large matrices efficiently.
- Ensure that the output from ModelNew matches the output from the original Model.
- Use appropriate CUDA optimization techniques such as shared memory, coalesced memory access, etc.
