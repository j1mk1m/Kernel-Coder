Your latest generated kernel:
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from depthwise_convolution import depthwise_convolution_cuda

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels: int, kernel_size: int, stride: int = 1, padding: int = 0, bias: bool = False):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(in_channels, kernel_size, kernel_size))
        self.stride = stride
        self.padding = padding

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return depthwise_convolution_cuda(x, self.weight, self.stride, self.padding)

# Test code
batch_size = 16
