Your latest generated kernel:
```
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
    
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        x = x.cuda()
        return apply_seLU(x)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
name 'apply_seLU' is not defined
