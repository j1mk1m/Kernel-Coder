Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
error: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```


Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Make further improvements based on feedback from previous evaluations.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.

Your final generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Final Evaluation Result:
```
All tests passed successfully. The custom CUDA kernel for cumulative sum is correctly implemented and performs significantly faster than the PyTorch version.
