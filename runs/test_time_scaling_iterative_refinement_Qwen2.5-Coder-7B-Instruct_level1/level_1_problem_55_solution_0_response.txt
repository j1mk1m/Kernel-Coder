Note: Feel free to change the kernel size, padding, etc., as long as it maintains the original functionality of the model. Your goal is to optimize the performance of the model using custom CUDA kernels. 

```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels: int, out_channels: int, kernel_size: int, stride: int = 1, padding: int = 0, dilation: int = 1, groups: int = 1, bias: bool = False):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Add custom CUDA kernels here

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Use custom CUDA kernels here
        pass
```
