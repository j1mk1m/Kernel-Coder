Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Analyze the operations performed by the original Model class.
2. Identify potential candidates for optimization using custom CUDA kernels.
3. Implement the chosen operations using CUDA kernels.
4. Replace the corresponding PyTorch operations with the custom CUDA kernels in the ModelNew class.
5. Ensure that the functionality of the ModelNew class remains identical to the original Model class.

Note: Feel free to optimize any part of the architecture, including but not limited to the transposed 1D convolution operation. Consider algorithmic improvements, operator fusion, or other techniques to achieve better performance.
