Here is a list of PyTorch operators that can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels:

- `torch.mean`: Can be replaced with a custom reduction kernel.
- `torch.abs`: Can be replaced with a custom absolute value kernel.
- `torch.div`: Can be replaced with a custom division kernel.

Please note that the goal is to optimize performance, so choose which operators to replace carefully. Replace as few operators as possible while achieving significant speedup. Also, feel free to experiment with different algorithms or techniques to further improve performance. For example, you could use online softmax instead of traditional softmax, or implement fused operations like batch matrix multiplication followed by ReLU activation.

Please do not include any unnecessary comments or explanations in the final code blocks. Only include the necessary code for the optimized architecture.
