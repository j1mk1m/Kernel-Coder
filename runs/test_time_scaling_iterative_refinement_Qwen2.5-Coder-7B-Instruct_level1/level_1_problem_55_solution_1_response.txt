Your latest generated kernel:
```
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels: int, out_channels: int, kernel_size: int, stride: int = 1, padding: int = 0, dilation: int = 1, groups: int = 1, bias: bool = False):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Add custom CUDA kernels here

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Use custom CUDA kernels here
        pass
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
AssertionError: Shapes do not match: expected torch.Size([8, 128, 512, 1024]), but got torch.Size([8, 128, 512, 1024])
