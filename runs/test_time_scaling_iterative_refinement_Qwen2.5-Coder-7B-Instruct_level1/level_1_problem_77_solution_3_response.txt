Please note that the evaluation result will be based on the correctness of the implementation and its performance compared to the original PyTorch implementation. Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel is implemented correctly and efficiently.

If there are any errors or issues with the implementation, please debug them and provide the corrected code. If the kernel is incorrect, please implement a correct one and ensure it performs well on the GPU.

Once you have a working and efficient custom CUDA kernel, you can proceed to optimize the architecture further by considering other operations that can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels, such as activation functions, batch normalization, etc.

Good luck with your optimization!
