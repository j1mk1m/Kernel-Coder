Please ensure that your implementation does not introduce any errors and correctly performs the same operations as the original PyTorch model. Additionally, optimize the kernel for better performance on GPU. 

Your latest generated kernel:
```
error: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
