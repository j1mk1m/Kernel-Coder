Please note that the error message might indicate a problem with the CUDA code syntax or logic. Make sure to review the CUDA code for any potential mistakes. If there are any errors related to the `load_inline` function, ensure that the CUDA source code is correctly formatted and that all necessary headers are included. Additionally, check the dimensions and types of the tensors being passed to the CUDA kernel to ensure they match the expected inputs.
