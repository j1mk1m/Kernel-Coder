Please note that the code should work for different batch sizes, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, depth, width, and height values. The optimized kernel should be able to handle these variations efficiently.

Here is your latest generated kernel:
```
AttributeError: module 'torch.cuda' has no attribute 'cufftPlanMany'
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
