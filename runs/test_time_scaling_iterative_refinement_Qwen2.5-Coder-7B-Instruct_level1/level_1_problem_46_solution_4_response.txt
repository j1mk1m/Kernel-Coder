Please ensure that the new architecture ModelNew is correctly implemented and achieves the same functionality as the original Model but with improved performance through custom CUDA kernels. If there are any errors during compilation or execution, please debug and fix them accordingly. Make sure the final implementation is both efficient and correct.

Your latest generated kernel:
```
error: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel were evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
