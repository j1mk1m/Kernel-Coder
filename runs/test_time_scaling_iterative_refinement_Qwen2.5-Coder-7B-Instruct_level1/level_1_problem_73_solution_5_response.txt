Your latest generated kernel:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Please continue to iterate until you achieve a working implementation that passes the evaluation. 
If you encounter any errors during the process, please provide the error message and debug the issue accordingly. 
Once the kernel is correctly implemented and verified, proceed to optimize the architecture by replacing the ConvTranspose3d layer with the custom CUDA kernel. Ensure that the final architecture maintains the same functionality as the original Model while utilizing the optimized kernel for improved performance.
