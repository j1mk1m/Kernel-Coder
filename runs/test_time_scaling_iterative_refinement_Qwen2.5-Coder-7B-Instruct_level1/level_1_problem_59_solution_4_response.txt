Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Please focus on optimizing the 3D convolution operation, which is computationally intensive. Consider using techniques such as algorithmic optimizations (e.g., grouped convolutions, fast GEMM algorithms), parallelization strategies, or even hardware-specific optimizations if applicable. Ensure that the optimized version produces the same results as the original reference implementation.

Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
