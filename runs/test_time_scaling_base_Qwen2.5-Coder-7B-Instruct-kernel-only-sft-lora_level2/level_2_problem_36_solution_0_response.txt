Please note that the code should be able to handle any batch size, input channels, output channels, kernel size, stride, padding, and output padding values provided in the `get_init_inputs` function.

The goal is to optimize the given architecture by replacing the most computationally expensive operations with custom CUDA kernels, thereby improving the performance of the model. Feel free to use any optimization techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, etc. that you deem appropriate. However, remember that you must provide the full implementation of the optimized architecture, including the definition of the custom CUDA kernels.
