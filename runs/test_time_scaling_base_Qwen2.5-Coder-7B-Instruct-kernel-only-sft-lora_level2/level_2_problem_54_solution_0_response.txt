### Constraints:
- Your custom CUDA operators should be efficient and take advantage of parallelism.
- You should aim to optimize the entire forward pass of the model, including any operations that can benefit from parallel computation.
- Feel free to add additional helper functions or classes as needed.

### Hints:
- Consider optimizing operations such as convolution, multiplication, activation functions, etc.
- You can use techniques like tensor core optimization for certain operations.
- Be mindful of memory bandwidth and try to minimize global memory accesses where possible.
- Feel free to experiment with different algorithms or data layouts to achieve better performance.

### Deliverables:
- A new architecture `ModelNew` that inherits from `nn.Module`.
- Fully functional code that compiles and runs without errors.
- Efficient use of CUDA parallelism to accelerate the forward pass.
