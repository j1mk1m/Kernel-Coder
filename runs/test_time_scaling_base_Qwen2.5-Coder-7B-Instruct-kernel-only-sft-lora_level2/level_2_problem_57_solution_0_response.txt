Make sure to include the necessary imports at the top of the file.

The final output should look something like this:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define your custom CUDA kernels here...

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize your custom CUDA operators here...

    def forward(self, x):
        # Use your custom CUDA operators in the forward pass...
```

Please note that you can use any combination of PyTorch operators and custom CUDA kernels to optimize the architecture. You can also choose to implement operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or other optimization techniques to improve performance. The goal is to achieve the highest possible speedup while maintaining the same functionality as the original architecture.
