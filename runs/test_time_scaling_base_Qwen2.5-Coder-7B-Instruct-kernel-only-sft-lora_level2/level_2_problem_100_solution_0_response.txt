Please note that I am looking for an optimization that will give me the most speedup possible. Your goal should be to maximize performance while keeping the code maintainable. Feel free to experiment with different approaches such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, etc. 

Note: The provided example shows how to add a custom CUDA operator for element-wise addition. You can use similar techniques to implement other operations. Remember that the key to achieving good performance is to minimize memory transfers between CPU and GPU and to optimize the use of parallelism.
