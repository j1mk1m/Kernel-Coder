The code should be fully functional, meaning it should be able to run without errors and produce correct results when called with appropriate inputs.

```python
model_new = ModelNew(*get_init_inputs())
inputs = get_inputs()
output = model_new(inputs[0])
print(output.shape)
```

should print:

```
torch.Size([1024, 8192])
```

and output should have the same values as if running `Model` with the same inputs.
