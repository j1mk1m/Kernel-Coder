The goal is to maximize performance, so feel free to optimize any part of the architecture including the choice of operators to replace with custom CUDA kernels, operator fusion, algorithmic changes, etc. You should aim to achieve significant speedup compared to the original implementation. 

Please provide a brief explanation of your optimizations in a comment at the top of the code.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define custom CUDA kernels here...

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, divisor, pool_size, bias_shape, sum_dim):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize custom layers or parameters here...
        pass

    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement the forward pass using custom CUDA kernels where appropriate...
        pass

```

```python
def get_inputs():
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, in_channels, depth, height, width)]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, divisor, pool_size, bias_shape, sum_dim]
```
