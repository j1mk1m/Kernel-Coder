Here's an example of how to use the `load_inline` function from PyTorch C++ Extensions:

```python
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the custom CUDA kernel source code here
custom_kernel_source_code = """
// Your CUDA kernel code goes here
"""

# Load the custom CUDA kernel using load_inline
custom_kernel_module = load_inline(
    name="custom_kernel",
    cpp_sources="",  # If there are no C++ sources, leave this empty
    cuda_sources=custom_kernel_source_code,
    functions=["your_function_name"],  # List the names of the functions you want to export
    verbose=True,  # Set to True to see detailed compilation information
    extra_cflags=[""],  # Additional compiler flags
    extra_ldflags=[""],  # Additional linker flags
)

# Use the custom CUDA kernel in your model
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.custom_op = custom_kernel_module.your_function_name

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.custom_op(x)
```

Use the above template to create your optimized `ModelNew`. Ensure that all operations within the `forward` method are either implemented in Python using PyTorch or replaced with custom CUDA kernels as demonstrated in the example. ```
