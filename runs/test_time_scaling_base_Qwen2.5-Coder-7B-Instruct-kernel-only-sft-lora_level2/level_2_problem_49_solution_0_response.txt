Note: The provided inputs to the `get_inputs` function can be used to test the performance of your optimized model.

## Requirements:
- Your implementation should aim to reduce computation time by utilizing CUDA capabilities.
- Feel free to use any CUDA features such as shared memory, texture caching, etc.
- If applicable, combine multiple operations into a single kernel for efficiency.
- Ensure that your custom CUDA kernels handle edge cases appropriately, such as boundary conditions in convolutional operations.
- Use appropriate data types for maximum performance and minimize memory usage.
- Keep the interface of the `ModelNew` class consistent with the original `Model` class (same method names, same argument types, same return types).
