Note: The goal is to optimize the performance of the model by replacing the PyTorch operators with custom CUDA kernels. Your solution should provide significant speedup compared to the original implementation.

Here is the code you can use to compile the inline CUDA code:

```python
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

model_new_source = """
// Add your custom CUDA kernels here
"""

model_new_cpp_source = (
    "void my_custom_function();"
)

model_new = load_inline(
    name="model_new",
    cpp_sources=model_new_cpp_source,
    cuda_sources=model_new_source,
    functions=["my_custom_function"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)
```

Replace `model_new_source` with your actual CUDA kernel code and `model_new_cpp_source` with the function declaration(s) for your custom CUDA kernel(s).

Make sure your custom CUDA kernels are well-optimized and follow best practices for parallel programming on NVIDIA GPUs. Also, ensure that your custom CUDA kernels handle edge cases and boundary conditions correctly. Finally, make sure that your custom CUDA kernels produce the same results as the corresponding PyTorch operators they replace.
