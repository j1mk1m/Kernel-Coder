Please note that you can use any CUDA features or libraries available, including cuDNN, but you must implement the operators yourself without relying on PyTorch's built-in CUDA operators. For example, you cannot use `torch.nn.functional.convolution` directly, you must write your own convolution kernel.

```markdown
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define custom CUDA kernels here...

# Compile the inline CUDA code here...

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, groups, bias=False):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize custom layers here...

    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement forward pass using custom CUDA operators...
        return x
```
```
