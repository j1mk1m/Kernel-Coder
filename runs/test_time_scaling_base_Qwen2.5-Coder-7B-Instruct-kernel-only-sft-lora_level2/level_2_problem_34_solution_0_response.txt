Note: You are free to choose any subset of operations to implement in CUDA, but be aware that implementing too many operations can lead to increased complexity and potential performance degradation due to overheads. Consider carefully which operations will provide the most significant speedup.

Also, feel free to use any relevant libraries or tools, such as PyTorch's C++ API or CUDA extensions, to assist in the implementation.
