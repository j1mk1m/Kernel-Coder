    Your solution should focus on optimizing the performance of the model by replacing certain operators with custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to optimize any part of the model, including but not limited to the transposed convolution, batch normalization, tanh activation, max pooling, and group normalization. Consider operator fusion, algorithmic changes, and other techniques to achieve better performance.

Please note that due to the complexity of the model and the potential variations in hardware, it might be challenging to observe significant improvements in performance. However, the goal is to demonstrate the process of optimizing a PyTorch model using custom CUDA operators.
