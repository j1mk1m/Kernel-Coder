The final result should be a new class `ModelNew` that implements the same functionality as the original `Model`, but uses custom CUDA operators where possible to achieve speedups.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    ...
```

Please ensure that all the operations inside the forward method are replaced with their respective custom CUDA operators where applicable. If an operation cannot be implemented with a custom CUDA operator, it should remain unchanged. Additionally, feel free to combine multiple operations into a single kernel if possible to further optimize performance.
