Here are the steps you need to follow:

- Choose which operators you want to replace with custom CUDA kernels. In this case, focus on the GEMM operation, max operation, subtraction, and GELU activation.
- Implement these operators using custom CUDA kernels.
- Replace the corresponding PyTorch operations in the `Model` class with the custom CUDA kernels.
- Ensure that the overall functionality of the model remains the same.

Please provide the full implementation of the `ModelNew` class. ```python
't
