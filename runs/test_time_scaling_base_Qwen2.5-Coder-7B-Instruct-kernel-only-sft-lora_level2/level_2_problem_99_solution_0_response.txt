Please note that you should use PyTorch's `load_inline` function to compile your custom CUDA kernels.

Here is the signature of the `load_inline` function:

```python
torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline(name, cpp_sources, cuda_sources, functions, verbose=False, extra_cflags=None, extra_ldflags=None)
```

Please make sure to include all necessary imports at the beginning of your code. 

Make sure your custom CUDA kernels are efficient and utilize parallelism effectively. Consider operator fusion and algorithmic changes to further optimize performance.

Provide the final implementation of the optimized architecture `ModelNew` in the answer.
