Please note that since PyTorch does not provide a direct CUDA implementation for `argmin`, you will need to implement it yourself using CUDA. This can be done by writing a CUDA kernel that iterates over each element in the tensor and keeps track of the minimum value and its corresponding index. Remember to handle edge cases such as empty tensors or tensors with all elements being equal.
