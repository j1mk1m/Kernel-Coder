Here is how you can test it:

```python
model = ModelNew()
inputs = get_inputs()
output = model(inputs[0], inputs[1])
print(output)
```

The output should be the same as the original `Model` but using custom CUDA operators for faster execution. Ensure that your implementation maintains the properties of upper triangular matrices after multiplication.
