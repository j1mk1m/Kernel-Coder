Here is a hint: You might want to look into optimizing the transposed 1D convolution operation using CUDA. Consider implementing a custom CUDA kernel that can perform the transposed 1D convolution more efficiently than PyTorch's built-in implementation. This could involve algorithmic optimizations such as shared memory usage, coalesced memory access, or other techniques to improve performance.
