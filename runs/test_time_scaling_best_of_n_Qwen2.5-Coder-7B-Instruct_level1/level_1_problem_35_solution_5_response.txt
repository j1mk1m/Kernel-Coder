Note: If you choose to implement a custom CUDA operator, you must provide the full source code for the CUDA kernel and any necessary C++ bindings. The CUDA kernel should be efficient and correctly implement the desired functionality. You should also ensure that the C++ bindings are correctly implemented and can be called from PyTorch. Additionally, you should provide any necessary setup or configuration steps required to compile and use the custom CUDA operator.
