### Constraints:
- Your solution must be compatible with PyTorch 1.10 or later.
- You can use `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` to compile the CUDA code.
- You should aim to achieve significant performance improvements over the original implementation.
- Ensure that the functionality remains identical to the original `Model`.

### Deliverables:
- A new class `ModelNew` that implements the same functionality as `Model`, but using custom CUDA kernels where possible.
- The new code should be fully functional and compatible with PyTorch 1.10 or later.
- The code should include all necessary imports and definitions.
- The code should be self-contained and ready to run without additional setup.
