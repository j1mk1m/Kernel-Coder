Please note that you can use any libraries such as PyTorch C++ API, PyTorch CUDA API, etc., but please ensure that the code is completely self-contained and does not rely on external files or resources beyond what is provided in the prompt. 

Remember that the goal is to achieve maximum performance improvement by leveraging custom CUDA kernels, so feel free to explore different optimization strategies such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or other techniques that could potentially lead to significant speedups.
