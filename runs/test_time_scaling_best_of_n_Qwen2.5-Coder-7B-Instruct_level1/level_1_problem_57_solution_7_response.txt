Here is an example of how to use the custom CUDA operator in the forward method:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the custom CUDA kernel for transposed 2D convolution
conv_transpose2d_source = """
// Your CUDA kernel implementation here
"""

conv_transpose2d_cpp_source = (
    // Your C++ function declaration here
)

# Compile the inline CUDA code for transposed 2D convolution
conv_transpose2d = load_inline(
    name="conv_transpose2d",
    cpp_sources=conv_transpose2d_cpp_source,
    cuda_sources=conv_transpose2d_source,
    functions=["conv_transpose2d_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)


class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels: int, out_channels: int, kernel_size: int, stride: int = 1, padding: int = 0, output_padding: int = 0, groups: int = 1, bias: bool = False):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.conv_transpose2d = conv_transpose2d

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.conv_transpose2d.conv_transpose2d_cuda(x)
```

Your solution should be similar but tailored to the specific requirements of the transposed 2D convolution operation. Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel is correctly implemented and integrated into the PyTorch model.
