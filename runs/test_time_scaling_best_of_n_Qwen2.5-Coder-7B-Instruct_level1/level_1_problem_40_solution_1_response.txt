Note: This problem does not require you to optimize the entire model but rather focus on optimizing the `LayerNorm` operation. You can choose to either implement the LayerNorm operation from scratch using CUDA, or use an existing implementation and wrap it in a Python class. Make sure to provide the full implementation of the `ModelNew` class.
