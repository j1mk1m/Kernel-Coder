Make sure to use `load_inline` from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile the CUDA kernels and integrate them into the PyTorch model. Be sure to include all necessary imports and define the CUDA kernels within the `elementwise_add_source` string. 

Also, please provide a brief explanation of why each CUDA kernel was chosen and how it improves performance over the original PyTorch implementation.
