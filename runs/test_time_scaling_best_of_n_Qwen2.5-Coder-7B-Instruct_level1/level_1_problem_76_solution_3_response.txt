### Note:
- Ensure that the `forward` method of `ModelNew` maintains the same functionality as the original `Model`.
- Feel free to experiment with different CUDA optimizations such as shared memory, coalesced memory access, and parallelism.
- The goal is to achieve significant speedup over the original implementation.
