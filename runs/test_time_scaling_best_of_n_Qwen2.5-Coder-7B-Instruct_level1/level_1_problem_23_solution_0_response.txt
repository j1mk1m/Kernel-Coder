Note: If you decide to use any other PyTorch operations, ensure they are implemented using standard PyTorch functionality unless otherwise specified. 

Also note that the goal here is to achieve maximum performance gains through efficient GPU utilization. Feel free to experiment with different strategies such as parallelization, memory access patterns, and algorithmic optimizations.
