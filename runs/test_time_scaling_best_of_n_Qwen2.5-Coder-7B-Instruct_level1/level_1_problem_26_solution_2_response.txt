Make sure to include the imports at the beginning of the code block. If you need to use any external libraries, make sure they are installed via pip or conda. 

The final architecture should be able to perform gelu activations faster than the original implementation. 

Note: Feel free to optimize other parts of the architecture if you see room for improvement, but the primary focus should be on optimizing the gelu activation. You can also consider operator fusion opportunities or algorithmic changes to achieve better performance.
