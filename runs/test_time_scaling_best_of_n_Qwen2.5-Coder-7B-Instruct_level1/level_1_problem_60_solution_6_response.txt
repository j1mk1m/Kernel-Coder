Here are some tips:

- Focus on optimizing the convolutional layer since it's likely the most computationally intensive part.
- Consider using grouped convolutions or other techniques to reduce memory bandwidth requirements.
- Use efficient memory access patterns in your CUDA kernel to maximize throughput.
- If applicable, implement an alternative algorithm that could be faster than the default PyTorch implementation.
