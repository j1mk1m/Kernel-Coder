The goal is to achieve maximum performance for the given architecture by leveraging custom CUDA kernels. Your solution should be as efficient as possible, considering parallelism, memory access patterns, and other factors that can impact GPU performance. Feel free to use any optimization techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or other methods to improve performance. Be creative and optimize the code as much as possible. ```
