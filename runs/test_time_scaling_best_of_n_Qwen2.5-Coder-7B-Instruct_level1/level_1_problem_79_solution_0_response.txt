The final output should be a new architecture called ModelNew that uses custom CUDA operators instead of the PyTorch default operators. Be sure to use the provided get_inputs() function to generate test inputs. Your custom CUDA operators should be compiled using the torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline method. Ensure that all necessary headers and libraries are included in your CUDA source code. ```python
