Please note that the provided architecture uses PyTorch's built-in `MaxPool3d` operator. To optimize it with custom CUDA operators, you need to create a new class called `ModelNew` that replaces the `MaxPool3d` operator with a custom CUDA implementation. Your solution should be efficient and take advantage of parallel computation capabilities of GPUs.
