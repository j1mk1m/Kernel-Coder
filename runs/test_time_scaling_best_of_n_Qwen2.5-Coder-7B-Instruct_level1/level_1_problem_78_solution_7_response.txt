The optimization should aim to improve performance while maintaining correctness. Feel free to choose which specific operations to optimize and how to implement them in CUDA. For example, you could replace the 2D transposed convolution with a custom implementation that utilizes shared memory or implements a different algorithm. Alternatively, you could fuse multiple operations together into a single kernel. The goal is to maximize performance without sacrificing functionality.
