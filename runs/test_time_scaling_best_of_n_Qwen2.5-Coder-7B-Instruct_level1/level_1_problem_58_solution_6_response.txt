Here is a hint about how to approach this task: You should focus on replacing the transposed 3D convolution operation with a custom CUDA kernel, as it is likely to be computationally intensive and can benefit significantly from parallelization on the GPU. You may also consider optimizing the memory access patterns and using efficient data layouts to further improve performance.
