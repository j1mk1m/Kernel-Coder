The goal is to maximize performance, so feel free to change any part of the architecture including the operator selection, fusion opportunities, and algorithmic changes. Feel free to use any CUDA features such as shared memory, texture memory, etc. but keep the code clean and understandable. 

Please provide the full code for the new architecture ModelNew in a single code block.
