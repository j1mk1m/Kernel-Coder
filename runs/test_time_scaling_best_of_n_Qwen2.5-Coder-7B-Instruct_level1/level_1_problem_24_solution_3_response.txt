Your solution should aim to maximize performance while maintaining correctness. Feel free to experiment with different strategies such as algorithmic optimizations, operator fusion, or even changing the overall architecture if it leads to significant improvements. The goal is to achieve the highest possible throughput on the target hardware (e.g., GPU).
