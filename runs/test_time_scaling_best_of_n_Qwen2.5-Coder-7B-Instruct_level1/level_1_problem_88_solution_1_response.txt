Please note that while optimizing the architecture, you can choose to optimize any part of the architecture, including but not limited to:

- Replacing the GELU activation function with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Implementing matrix multiplication and other linear algebra operations using custom CUDA kernels.
- Combining multiple operations into a single kernel.
- Using efficient algorithms such as fused softmax.

Make sure your implementation is efficient and takes full advantage of GPU parallelism.
