Here's how I will evaluate your solution:

- **Correctness**: Does the optimized model produce the same results as the original model?
- **Speedup**: Is there a significant speedup compared to the original model? You can use timeit or similar tools to measure performance.
- **Efficiency**: Are the custom CUDA kernels efficient and well-implemented?

Please provide your solution in the requested format.
