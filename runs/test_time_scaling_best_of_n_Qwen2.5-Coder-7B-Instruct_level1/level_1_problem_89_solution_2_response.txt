Note: Feel free to add any additional imports or helper functions you need. Make sure all operations are performed on the GPU. If there is an equivalent operator in PyTorch that is already implemented in C++, it is okay to use the existing implementation instead of creating a custom one. However, try to optimize the performance as much as possible.
