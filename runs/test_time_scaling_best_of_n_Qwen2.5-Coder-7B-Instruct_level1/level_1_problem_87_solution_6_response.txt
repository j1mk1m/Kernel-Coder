Please ensure that your implementation uses efficient memory access patterns and follows best practices for CUDA programming. Consider using shared memory, coalesced memory accesses, and other techniques to optimize performance. Also, consider algorithmic optimizations such as fused convolutions or other techniques to further improve performance.
