**Note**: Your custom CUDA kernels should be efficient and handle edge cases such as varying batch sizes, different kernel sizes, and various padding settings. Consider using shared memory, coalesced memory access patterns, and other techniques to optimize performance. You may also need to modify the input/output shapes or data types of the operators to fit your custom CUDA kernels. Ensure that your custom operators produce the same results as the original PyTorch operators for correctness.
