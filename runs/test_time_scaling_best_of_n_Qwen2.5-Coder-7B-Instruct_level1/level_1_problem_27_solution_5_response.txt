Here are the steps to follow:

- Replace the SELU operation with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel has proper error handling and memory management.
- Verify that the custom CUDA kernel produces the same results as the original SELU operation.
- Optimize the kernel for performance, considering parallelization techniques such as grid and block dimensions.
- If necessary, implement additional optimizations, such as fused operations or algorithmic changes.

Please provide the optimized architecture in Python using PyTorch and C++ extensions. Make sure the code is well-commented and follows best practices. ```python
