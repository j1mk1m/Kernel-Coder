Please include all necessary imports and ensure that the function signatures remain identical to those in the original Model class (e.g., `forward`, `__init__`). Your goal is to optimize the performance of the model using custom CUDA operators wherever possible. 

Remember to provide a brief explanation of any optimizations made, including why they were chosen and how they potentially impact performance.
