The optimization should aim to maximize performance while maintaining correctness. Feel free to optimize any part of the architecture including but not limited to:

- Replacing the matrix multiplication with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Combining matrix multiplication with other operations such as adding a bias vector or applying an activation function.
- Using fused kernels for efficiency.
- Implementing more efficient algorithms for matrix multiplication.

Make sure to comment on the optimizations you made and why they are beneficial. If you decide not to optimize a particular part of the architecture, explain your reasoning.
