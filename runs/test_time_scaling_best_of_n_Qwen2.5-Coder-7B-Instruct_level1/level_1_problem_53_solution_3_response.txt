Here are some guidelines for your optimization:

- Use the `load_inline` function from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile and link your custom CUDA kernels.
- Replace the `torch.min` operation with a custom CUDA kernel that performs the min reduction over the specified dimension.
- Ensure that your custom CUDA kernel is efficient and leverages parallel computation to achieve speedup.
- Consider any optimizations such as shared memory usage or coalesced memory access patterns to further improve performance.
- Your solution should be self-contained and include all necessary imports and definitions.
- Make sure that the `get_inputs` and `get_init_inputs` functions remain unchanged and produce valid inputs for your optimized model.
- The output model should maintain the same functionality as the original model but execute faster due to the use of custom CUDA kernels.

Here's an example of how you might start implementing the custom CUDA kernel:

```python
min_reduction_source = """
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Custom CUDA kernel for min reduction
__global__ void min_reduction_kernel(...) {
    // Kernel implementation goes here
}

torch::Tensor min_reduction_cuda(torch::Tensor x, int dim) {
    // Launch kernel and return result
}
"""
```

```python
min_reduction_cpp_source = (
    "torch::Tensor min_reduction_cuda(torch::Tensor x, int dim);"
)

# Compile the inline CUDA code for min reduction
min_reduction = load_inline(
    name="min_reduction",
    cpp_sources=min_reduction_cpp_source,
    cuda_sources=min_reduction_source,
    functions=["min_reduction_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)
```

```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim: int):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.dim = dim
        self.min_reduction = min_reduction

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.min_reduction.min_reduction_cuda(x, self.dim)
```

Please follow these guidelines and provide the full implementation of the optimized model `ModelNew`. ```python
