Hint: Consider optimizing the Group Normalization operation. Group Normalization can be computationally expensive due to its reliance on batch statistics and normalization across groups. You could explore alternative approaches such as using instance normalization instead, which might offer better performance on certain types of data. Alternatively, you could implement a more efficient version of Group Normalization using CUDA.
