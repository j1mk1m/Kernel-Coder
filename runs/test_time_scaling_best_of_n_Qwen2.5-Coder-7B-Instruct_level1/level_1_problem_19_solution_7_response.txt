The optimization should aim to achieve faster execution times by leveraging custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to optimize any part of the architecture, including but not limited to the ReLU activation. Consider potential optimizations such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or using efficient CUDA primitives. Ensure that the optimized version maintains the same functionality as the original model. 

Please provide the new code in Python using PyTorch and CUDA. The code should be completely self-contained and include all necessary imports. Make sure that the new model can be instantiated and used for inference without modification.
