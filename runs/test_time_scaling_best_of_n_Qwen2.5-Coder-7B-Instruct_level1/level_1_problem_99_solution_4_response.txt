Hint: You can use PyTorch C++ API to define custom CUDA operators. Alternatively, you can use PyTorch Cuda Extensions to define custom CUDA operators. 

Note: Your implementation should be efficient and take advantage of parallelism available in GPUs. You should also aim to minimize memory usage and maximize throughput.
