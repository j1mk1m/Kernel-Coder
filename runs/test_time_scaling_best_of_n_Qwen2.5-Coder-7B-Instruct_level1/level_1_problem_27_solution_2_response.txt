The resulting `ModelNew` should be able to run on both CPU and GPU, but it must perform at least as well as the original `Model` on GPU. If possible, improve performance further. You can assume the input tensor will always fit into memory. Your goal is to optimize the SELU operation using a custom CUDA kernel, if possible, and other operations that could benefit from custom implementations.
