Please follow the same structure as in the example provided above. Make sure you include all necessary imports and any other setup code. 

Note: This question asks for optimization using custom CUDA kernels, so do not use PyTorch's built-in fused operations or other high-level optimizations provided by PyTorch. You must implement the operation(s) yourself using CUDA.
