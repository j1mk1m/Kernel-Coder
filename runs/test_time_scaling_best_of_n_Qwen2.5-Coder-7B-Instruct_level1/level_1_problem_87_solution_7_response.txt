### Guidelines:
- Replace any operations that can benefit from GPU acceleration with custom CUDA kernels.
- Consider operator fusion and algorithmic changes to further optimize performance.
- Ensure that the functionality remains consistent with the original architecture.
- Use appropriate CUDA programming techniques and best practices.
