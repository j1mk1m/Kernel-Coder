Please note that the goal is to optimize the `forward` method of the `Model` class, which applies RMS Normalization. The `rms` calculation involves squaring each element, taking the mean across the feature dimension, adding a small constant (`eps`) for numerical stability, and then taking the square root. This can be computationally intensive, so we aim to replace it with a more efficient implementation using custom CUDA kernels.

### Guidelines:
1. **Efficiency**: Focus on optimizing the `rms` calculation, which is a critical part of the RMS Normalization process.
2. **Custom CUDA Kernels**: Implement custom CUDA kernels for the `rms` calculation and any other operations that could benefit from parallel processing.
3. **Algorithmic Changes**: Consider alternative algorithms that might be faster or more numerically stable.
4. **Operator Fusion**: Combine multiple operations into a single kernel if possible to reduce overhead.
5. **Memory Access Patterns**: Optimize memory access patterns to maximize GPU performance.

### Deliverables:
- The optimized architecture `ModelNew`.
- Ensure that the `get_inputs` function remains unchanged.
- Ensure that the `get_init_inputs` function remains unchanged.
- The code should compile and run without errors.
