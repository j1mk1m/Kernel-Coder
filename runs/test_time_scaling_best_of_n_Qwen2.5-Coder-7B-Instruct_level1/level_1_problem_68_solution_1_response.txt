Here's a list of possible CUDA operators that could be replaced:

- Convolution operations (convolution, transposed convolution)
- Element-wise operations (addition, multiplication, etc.)
- Activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)
- Pooling operations (max pooling, average pooling)
- Normalization layers (BatchNorm, LayerNorm)
- Loss functions (CrossEntropyLoss, MSELoss)
- Optimizers (SGD, Adam, etc.)

Feel free to choose any combination of these operators to optimize the performance of the given architecture. Consider both computational efficiency and memory usage when making your decisions.
