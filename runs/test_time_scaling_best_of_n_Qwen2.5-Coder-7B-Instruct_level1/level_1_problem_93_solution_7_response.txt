Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Identify the operations that can be accelerated using custom CUDA kernels.
2. Write the CUDA kernels for these operations.
3. Replace the PyTorch operators with the custom CUDA kernels in the `Model` class.
4. Ensure the new architecture (`ModelNew`) is fully functional and maintains the same behavior as the original `Model`.

Please provide the final code for `ModelNew`.
