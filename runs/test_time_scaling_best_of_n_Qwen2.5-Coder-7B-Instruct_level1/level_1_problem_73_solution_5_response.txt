### Requirements:

- Replace the `nn.ConvTranspose3d` layer with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel performs the same computation as the original PyTorch operator.
- Your solution should be efficient in terms of memory usage and execution time.
- Use appropriate CUDA programming techniques such as shared memory, coalesced memory access, etc., where applicable.

Please provide the optimized architecture named `ModelNew`. ```python
