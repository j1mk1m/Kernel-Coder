Here are some tips:

- Consider using group normalization as a candidate for optimization because it involves matrix operations that can be parallelized efficiently on GPUs.
- Think about whether there are any ways to fuse multiple operations together within the Group Normalization operation itself.
- If you decide to implement a custom CUDA kernel, ensure that the kernel is efficient and leverages GPU parallelism effectively.
- Make sure that your implementation is compatible with PyTorch's autograd system so that gradients can still be computed correctly.
