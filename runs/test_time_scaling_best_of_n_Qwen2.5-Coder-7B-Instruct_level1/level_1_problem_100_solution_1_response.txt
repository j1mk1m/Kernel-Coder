### Note:

- Make sure that all operations are properly defined in the new architecture.
- Ensure that the model can still be trained and evaluated using PyTorch.
- Your solution should aim to optimize performance while maintaining correctness.
- Feel free to use any PyTorch functionalities and CUDA features to achieve your goal.
- You may need to adjust the batch size and other parameters to ensure compatibility and performance.

### Guidelines:

- Focus on optimizing the forward pass where possible.
- Consider operator fusion and algorithmic improvements.
- If necessary, introduce additional layers or components to improve performance.
- Ensure that the final implementation is efficient and easy to understand.
