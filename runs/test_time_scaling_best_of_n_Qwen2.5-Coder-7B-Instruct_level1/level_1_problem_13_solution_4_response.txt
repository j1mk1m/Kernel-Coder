Here are some guidelines for optimization:

- Replace `torch.matmul` with a custom CUDA kernel for faster performance.
- Consider using shared memory within the CUDA kernel to improve cache utilization.
- Implement any necessary synchronization mechanisms to ensure correctness.
- Optimize the block and grid dimensions for maximum parallelism.
- If applicable, implement algorithmic optimizations such as fused operations or more efficient data layouts.

Please provide the optimized code for ModelNew.
