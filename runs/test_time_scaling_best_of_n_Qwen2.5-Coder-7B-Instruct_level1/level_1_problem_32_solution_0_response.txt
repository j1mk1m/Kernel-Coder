Please provide the entire code for ModelNew, including imports, class definition, and forward method. Make sure the class name is changed to ModelNew. Use the provided `get_inputs` and `get_init_inputs` functions to verify the functionality of your new model. Your implementation should use custom CUDA kernels for the HardTanh operation. You may need to adjust the CUDA kernel to handle different data types or batch sizes if necessary. Ensure that the output of ModelNew matches the output of the original Model when using the provided input tensors.
