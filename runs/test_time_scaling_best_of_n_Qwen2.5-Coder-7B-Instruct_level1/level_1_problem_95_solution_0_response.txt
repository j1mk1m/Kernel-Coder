```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your CUDA kernel code goes here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, predictions, targets):
        # Use your custom CUDA kernel here
        pass
```

Your answer should be a full implementation of `ModelNew` using custom CUDA kernels where appropriate.
