### Constraints:
- Use PyTorch's `load_inline` function to compile the CUDA code.
- Ensure that all operations are correctly mapped to their CUDA counterparts.
- Maintain the functionality of the original architecture.
- Provide clear documentation on how the CUDA kernel was implemented and why it was chosen over the default PyTorch implementation.
