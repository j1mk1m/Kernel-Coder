The optimization should aim to achieve higher performance by replacing the PyTorch operations with custom CUDA kernels where appropriate. Feel free to explore different optimization strategies such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or any other technique that can lead to performance improvements. 

Please ensure that the resulting architecture (`ModelNew`) has the same functionality as the original architecture (`Model`). That is, it should produce the same output for the same input.
