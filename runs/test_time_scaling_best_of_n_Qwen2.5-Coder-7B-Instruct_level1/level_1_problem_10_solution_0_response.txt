### Requirements:
- Replace the `torch.matmul` operation with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Ensure that the output tensor has the correct shape (N, M, L).
- Optimize the CUDA kernel for performance, considering efficient memory access patterns and parallelism.
- Use appropriate CUDA libraries and tools to ensure correctness and efficiency.
- Provide the full implementation of `ModelNew`, including any necessary imports and helper functions.
