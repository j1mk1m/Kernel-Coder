Your solution should include replacing at least one operator with a custom CUDA kernel and optionally operator fusion or algorithmic changes. Be creative and aim for maximum performance gains.

Here's how the final output should look:

```python
# Your optimized ModelNew class here
```

```python
# Example usage of the optimized model
model_new = ModelNew(features)
input_data = get_inputs()[0]
output = model_new(input_data)
print(output.shape)
```

Make sure the provided example usage works correctly with the optimized model.
