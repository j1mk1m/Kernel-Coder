Here are some tips:

- Use PyTorch's `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` to define and compile custom CUDA kernels directly within Python.
- Ensure that your custom CUDA kernels are efficient and handle edge cases properly.
- If necessary, modify the architecture to fuse multiple operations into a single CUDA kernel for better performance.
- Optimize the Softmax operation using techniques such as log-sum-exp trick or other optimization strategies suitable for GPU execution.
