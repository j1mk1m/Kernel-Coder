Here are some guidelines:

- Your custom CUDA kernel should be efficient and well-optimized.
- You can use PyTorch's `load_inline` function to compile and link your custom CUDA kernel.
- Ensure that the new architecture `ModelNew` has the same functionality as the original `Model`.
- If possible, try to optimize the operation further by fusing it with other operations or using more efficient algorithms.
