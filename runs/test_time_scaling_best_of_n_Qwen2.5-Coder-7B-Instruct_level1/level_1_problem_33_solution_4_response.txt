Make sure to use `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` to compile the CUDA kernels. Provide the full source code for the CUDA kernels, including any necessary headers. Your implementation should aim to maximize performance while maintaining correctness.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# BEGIN SOLUTION
[Your CUDA kernel source code here]
# END SOLUTION

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features: int):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(num_features=num_features)
        self.bn_forward = bn_forward

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.bn_forward(self.bn, x)

def bn_forward(bn_layer, x):
    # BEGIN SOLUTION
    [Your CUDA kernel call here]
    # END SOLUTION
    pass
```

Please ensure your solution includes all necessary imports and is self-contained. ```python
```
