### Requirements:

- Use a custom CUDA kernel for the max pool operation instead of using PyTorch's built-in `nn.MaxPool2d`.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel correctly implements the max pooling functionality.
- Keep the rest of the model architecture unchanged.
- The new architecture should still produce the same output as the original architecture when called with the same inputs.
