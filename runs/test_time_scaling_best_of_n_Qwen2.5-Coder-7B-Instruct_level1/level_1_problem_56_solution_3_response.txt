Please note that you can replace any part of the Model architecture with a custom CUDA kernel, including the entire forward pass. Feel free to experiment with different approaches and combinations. The goal is to achieve maximum performance improvement while maintaining functionality. 

Remember that you should be able to compile and run the code using PyTorch and CUDA without errors. Make sure to include all necessary imports and dependencies.
