Note that the inputs to the Model class are always of type torch.Tensor with shape (batch_size, in_channels, height, width). You should aim to optimize the performance of the forward pass of the Model class using custom CUDA kernels. You can choose which operations to replace with custom CUDA kernels based on your analysis of the computational workload and potential performance improvements. Feel free to experiment with different optimization strategies such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, etc.
