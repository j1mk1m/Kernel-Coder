Your solution should be optimized for speedup, but also maintain correctness. You may use any PyTorch or CUDA features available. 

Remember, you can implement any custom CUDA kernel to optimize the model, such as replacing the average pooling operation with a more efficient algorithm, or fusing multiple operations together into a single kernel. Be creative and think about what might be the most effective optimizations for this specific architecture. 

Please provide the full code for the ModelNew class and the necessary setup for compiling and running the code. Ensure that the code is self-contained and clear. ```
