Here are some guidelines:
- Use PyTorch extensions to create custom CUDA operators.
- Implement the custom CUDA operator for the `MaxPool2d` operation.
- Ensure the custom CUDA operator matches the behavior of the original PyTorch `MaxPool2d`.
- Make sure the architecture can still be instantiated and used correctly.
- Optimize the performance of the `forward` method using the custom CUDA operator.
