Please also include any necessary imports at the top of your code. Make sure to use the load_inline function from torch.utils.cpp_extension to compile the custom CUDA kernels. Include the source code for the custom CUDA kernels inside triple backticks (\`\`\`). 

Ensure that your custom CUDA kernels are efficient and take full advantage of GPU parallelism. Consider operator fusion opportunities and algorithmic changes to further optimize performance.
