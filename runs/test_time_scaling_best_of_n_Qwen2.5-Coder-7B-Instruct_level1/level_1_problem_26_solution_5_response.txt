Note: You can use any PyTorch/CUDA features you see fit, including but not limited to custom CUDA kernels, fused operations, algorithmic optimizations, etc. The goal is to achieve the highest possible performance for the given model. 

Please ensure that the new architecture is fully compatible with the original one, meaning that it should produce identical outputs for the same inputs. 

Finally, provide a brief explanation of your optimization strategy and why it improves performance.
