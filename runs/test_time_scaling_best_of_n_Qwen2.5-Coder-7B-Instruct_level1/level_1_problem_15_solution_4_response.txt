### Requirements:

- You must use CUDA for acceleration.
- You can only modify the `Model` class to create a new class called `ModelNew`.
- You should aim to optimize the performance of the matrix multiplication operation using CUDA.
- Your solution should be efficient and handle large matrix sizes (e.g., M = 4096).
- Feel free to use any CUDA features such as shared memory, texture memory, etc., to further improve performance.

### Constraints:

- The implementation should be in Python and utilize PyTorch's CUDA capabilities.
- Ensure that the `forward` method of `ModelNew` returns the same results as the original `Model`'s `forward` method.
- The code should be compilable and runnable without errors.

### Example Usage:

```python
model_new = ModelNew().cuda()
A = torch.rand(M, M).cuda()
B = torch.rand(M, M).cuda()
A = torch.tril(A)
B = torch.tril(B)
result = model_new(A, B)
print(result)
```

This code should produce the same output as the original `Model` when run on a GPU.
