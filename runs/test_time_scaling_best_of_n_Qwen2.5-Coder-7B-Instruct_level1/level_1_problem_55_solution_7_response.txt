**Note:** You can use any libraries available in PyTorch, but focus on optimizing the convolution operation. Feel free to experiment with different approaches such as using grouped convolutions, depthwise separable convolutions, or other optimization techniques. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining the functionality of the original model.
