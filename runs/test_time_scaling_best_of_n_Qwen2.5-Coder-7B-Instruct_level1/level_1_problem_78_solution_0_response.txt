Hint: Consider optimizing the 2D transposed convolution operation using a custom CUDA kernel that implements the operation more efficiently than the PyTorch implementation. One possible approach is to use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency, or to unroll loops to increase instruction-level parallelism. Another possible approach is to use algorithmic optimizations such as the Winograd filter transform to reduce the number of multiplications required by the convolution.
