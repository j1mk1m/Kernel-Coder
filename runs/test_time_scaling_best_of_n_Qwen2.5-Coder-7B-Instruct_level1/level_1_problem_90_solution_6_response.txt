## Constraints:

- Use CUDA for acceleration wherever possible.
- Optimize for performance without compromising correctness.
- Ensure that the new architecture maintains the same functionality as the original.
- Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools if necessary.

## Deliverables:

- The updated architecture `ModelNew` with custom CUDA operators.
- Any additional code or setup required to compile and run the new architecture.
