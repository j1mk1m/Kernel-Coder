Here's how you should approach it:

- Analyze the operations being performed in the original `Model`.
- Identify potential candidates for optimization using custom CUDA kernels.
- Write the CUDA kernel code.
- Load the CUDA kernel into PyTorch using `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline`.
- Replace the corresponding operation in the `forward` method of `Model` with the custom CUDA kernel.
- Ensure the new architecture (`ModelNew`) maintains the same functionality as the original `Model`.

Please provide the full code for `ModelNew`, including any necessary imports and helper functions. ```python
