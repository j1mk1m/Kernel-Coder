Please ensure that the code uses the torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline method to compile the CUDA code. Also, please provide the CUDA source code that defines the custom CUDA kernel for the batched matrix multiplication operation. The CUDA kernel should be optimized for performance on modern NVIDIA GPUs. Make sure to include any necessary headers and define the kernel function using the appropriate CUDA syntax. Finally, ensure that the custom CUDA kernel is called from the forward pass of the ModelNew class.
