    Your custom CUDA operators should be implemented using the syntax provided in the example above. Be creative with your choices of which operators to optimize and how to combine them for performance gains. Consider algorithmic optimizations as well as implementation-level optimizations. For example, you might choose to implement online softmax instead of calling PyTorch's softmax function, or you might choose to fuse multiple operations into a single kernel to reduce memory bandwidth and improve occupancy. 

    Note that the inputs to the `get_inputs` function will vary depending on the specific requirements of the model. Make sure that your optimized version of the model can handle these inputs correctly.
