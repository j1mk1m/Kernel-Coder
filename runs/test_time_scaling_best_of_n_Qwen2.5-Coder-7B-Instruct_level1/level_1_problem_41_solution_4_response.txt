Note: Feel free to use any libraries you need to implement the custom CUDA operators. You can use `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile and load the CUDA extensions. You should aim to optimize the performance of the Max Pooling 1D operation using custom CUDA kernels. Consider algorithmic changes, such as replacing the standard max pooling with a more efficient implementation. You are encouraged to explore different approaches to achieve the best possible performance.
