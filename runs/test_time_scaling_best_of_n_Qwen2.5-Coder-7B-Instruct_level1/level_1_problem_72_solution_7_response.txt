Hint: Consider optimizing the 3D transposed convolution operation using a custom CUDA kernel. This could involve implementing the convolution manually using CUDA threads to achieve better performance than the PyTorch default implementation. Additionally, consider whether there are any opportunities for operator fusion or algorithmic changes that could further improve performance.
