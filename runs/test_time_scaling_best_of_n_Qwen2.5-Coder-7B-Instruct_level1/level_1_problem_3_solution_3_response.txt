Your solution should aim to provide significant performance improvements over the original implementation, ideally by reducing memory bandwidth usage or utilizing parallelism more effectively. Consider algorithmic optimizations such as using efficient matrix multiplication algorithms (e.g., Strassen's algorithm, GEMM libraries) or implementing the operation manually in CUDA. 

Please ensure that your custom CUDA kernels are well-documented and include appropriate error handling and synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions and other concurrency issues. Finally, verify that your optimized implementation produces correct results compared to the original PyTorch implementation.
