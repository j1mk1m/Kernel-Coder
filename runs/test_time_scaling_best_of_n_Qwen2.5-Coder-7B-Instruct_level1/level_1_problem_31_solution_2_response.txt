Note: You can use `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` to compile and load the CUDA kernels. Make sure to include all necessary headers and define the CUDA kernels within the source strings. 

Please provide the full implementation of ModelNew including the custom CUDA kernel definition and the corresponding PyTorch module definition.
