Please note that the goal here is to improve the performance of the model by replacing PyTorch operators with custom CUDA kernels where appropriate. This could involve optimizing the existing operation, fusing multiple operations together, or using more efficient algorithms. Be creative!

### Note:

- Your solution should be fully self-contained and include all necessary imports.
- Ensure that the `get_inputs` function returns inputs that match the expected dimensions and types for your optimized model.
- Verify that the `ModelNew` class correctly implements the L1 normalization operation using the custom CUDA kernel(s).
- Provide a brief explanation of any optimizations or techniques used in your implementation.
