Please note that the provided architecture has a single operation which can be replaced with a custom CUDA kernel. Your task is to optimize it by replacing the single operation with a custom CUDA kernel. Make sure that the custom CUDA kernel is correctly implemented and integrated into the new architecture. Ensure that the new architecture maintains the same functionality as the original architecture but with improved performance.
