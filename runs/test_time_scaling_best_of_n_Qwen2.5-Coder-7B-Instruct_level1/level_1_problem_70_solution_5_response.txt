The new architecture should be optimized for GPU performance. Feel free to choose which operators to optimize, whether to fuse them, or to implement algorithmic changes that could lead to better performance on the GPU. You should aim to achieve faster execution times compared to the original PyTorch implementation.

Please note that the goal is to provide a working solution that can be compiled and run without errors. The focus should be on optimizing the performance of the given architecture using custom CUDA kernels.
