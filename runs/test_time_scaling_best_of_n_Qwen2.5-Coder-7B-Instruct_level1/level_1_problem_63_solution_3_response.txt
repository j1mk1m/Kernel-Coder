Hint: Consider using shared memory for the convolution kernel to reduce global memory access times. Also, consider implementing a sliding window approach to further optimize the convolution process. Additionally, you can implement a custom CUDA kernel for the ReLU activation function to improve performance.

Please note that the goal is to achieve the highest possible speedup by optimizing the given architecture with custom CUDA operators. You should carefully analyze the architecture and identify the most critical parts that benefit the most from optimization. Remember that the key to achieving high performance is to minimize global memory access and maximize parallelism.
