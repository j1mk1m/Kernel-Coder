Please use `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` to compile the CUDA kernels and replace the Sigmoid operation with a custom CUDA implementation. Your solution should be efficient and take advantage of parallel computation capabilities of GPUs. 

Ensure your code adheres to the guidelines provided.
