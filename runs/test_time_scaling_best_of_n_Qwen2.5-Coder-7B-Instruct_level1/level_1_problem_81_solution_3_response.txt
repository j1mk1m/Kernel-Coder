Note: You are free to choose which specific operations to optimize with custom CUDA kernels, but you should aim to improve performance where possible. For instance, you might choose to implement the 2D transposed convolution operation using a custom CUDA kernel instead of relying on PyTorch's built-in implementation. This could involve optimizing the memory access patterns, parallelizing the computation, or using specialized algorithms. Remember that the goal is to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining correctness.
