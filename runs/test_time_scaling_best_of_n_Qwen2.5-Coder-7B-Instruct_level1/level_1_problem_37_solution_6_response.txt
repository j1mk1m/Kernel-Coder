Here's how you might approach this problem:

- Identify the key operations in the original model.
- Decide which of these operations can be accelerated using custom CUDA kernels.
- Write the CUDA kernels for those operations.
- Replace the corresponding PyTorch operations in the model with calls to the custom CUDA kernels.
- Ensure that the overall functionality remains unchanged.
- Test the optimized model to ensure it produces correct results and achieves the desired performance improvements.
