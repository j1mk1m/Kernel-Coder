Please note that you should provide the full code for ModelNew, including imports, class definition, and any additional helper functions. You may also need to modify the get_inputs function to work with your new architecture. Ensure that the overall functionality remains the same, i.e., performing a transposed 2D convolution with the provided inputs.
