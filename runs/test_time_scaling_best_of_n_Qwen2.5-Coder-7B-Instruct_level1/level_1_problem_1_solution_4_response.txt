### Requirements:
- Use CUDA for matrix multiplication.
- Implement any additional necessary helper functions or classes.
- Ensure that the overall functionality remains the same (i.e., the output should be identical to the original `Model` class).
- If you implement additional functionality (e.g., fused operations), explain it briefly in the comments.

### Note:
You can use any PyTorch utility functions or modules as needed, but ensure they are compatible with CUDA operations.
