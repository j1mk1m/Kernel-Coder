Your solution should include at least one custom CUDA operator and can be more than one if necessary. Feel free to optimize any part of the architecture that could benefit from custom CUDA kernels. 

Note: For simplicity, assume that the device is always CUDA. 

Here's a hint: Consider optimizing the 3D convolution operation using custom CUDA kernels. A possible approach is to use shared memory for storing intermediate results and reduce global memory access. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large input sizes and deep networks.
