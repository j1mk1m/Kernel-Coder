Please note that you should use the PyTorch extension `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to create the custom CUDA kernel. Make sure that your CUDA kernel performs the same function as the original PyTorch operator but in a more efficient manner. You can optimize any part of the code, including the initialization, forward pass, etc. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining correctness.
