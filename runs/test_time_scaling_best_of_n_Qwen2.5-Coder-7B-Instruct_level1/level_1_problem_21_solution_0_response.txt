Your solution should include the CUDA source code for the custom operator, the corresponding C++ wrapper function, and the updated `ModelNew` class definition. Your goal is to maximize performance while maintaining correctness. Feel free to experiment with different approaches, such as using shared memory, parallelizing across multiple threads, or employing more efficient algorithms. However, ensure that your implementation adheres to the principles of CUDA programming and maintains the integrity of the original model functionality.
