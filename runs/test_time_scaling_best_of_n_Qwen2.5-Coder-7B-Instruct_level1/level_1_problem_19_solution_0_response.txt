Please note that the goal here is to optimize the performance of the model using custom CUDA operators where applicable. Feel free to experiment with different operators, such as linear layers, convolutional layers, etc., but focus primarily on the ReLU operation for this task. You may also consider other optimization techniques, such as operator fusion or algorithmic changes. 

Your solution should provide a significant improvement in terms of computational efficiency compared to the original implementation. ```python
