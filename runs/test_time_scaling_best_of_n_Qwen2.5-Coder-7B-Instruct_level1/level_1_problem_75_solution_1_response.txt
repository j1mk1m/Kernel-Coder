Please note that the custom CUDA operators should be implemented in C++ or CUDA C and loaded using PyTorch's `load_inline` function. The custom operators should be used to replace the PyTorch operators in the `forward` method of the `ModelNew` class. The custom operators should be designed to achieve better performance than the default PyTorch operators. 

Make sure that the custom CUDA operators are properly initialized and that the `ModelNew` class can be instantiated and used without any issues. The custom CUDA operators should be compatible with the existing PyTorch data types and operations.
