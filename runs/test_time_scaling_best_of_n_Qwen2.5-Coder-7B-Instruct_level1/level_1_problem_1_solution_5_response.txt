Here is a guide on how to approach this problem:

- Identify which operations can be accelerated using custom CUDA kernels.
- Write the CUDA kernels for these operations.
- Integrate the CUDA kernels into PyTorch via `load_inline`.
- Replace the original PyTorch operations with the custom CUDA kernels in the `forward` method of the `ModelNew` class.
