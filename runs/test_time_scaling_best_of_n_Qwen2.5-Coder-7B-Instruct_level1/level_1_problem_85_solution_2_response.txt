### Requirements:
- You can use any CUDA libraries available in PyTorch.
- You should aim to optimize the performance of the depthwise 2D convolution operation (`nn.Conv2d`).
- Feel free to modify other parts of the architecture if it leads to better performance.
- The final implementation should be fully functional and compile without errors.

### Hints:
- Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
- Explore different algorithms or techniques to improve the efficiency of the convolution operation.
- You can also experiment with different kernel sizes and strides to find the optimal configuration.
- Remember that the goal is to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining correctness.
