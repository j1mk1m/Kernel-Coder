Note: The goal is to optimize the `forward` method of the `Model` class using custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to change any part of the architecture as long as it maintains the same functionality. For instance, you can add additional layers, change the data types, etc. but the final output should still be a valid PyTorch model that produces the same results as the original model.
