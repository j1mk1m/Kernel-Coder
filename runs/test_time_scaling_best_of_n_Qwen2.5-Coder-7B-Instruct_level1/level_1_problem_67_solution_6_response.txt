Please note that the original model uses PyTorch's built-in Conv1d layer which is implemented in C++. Your task is to optimize it using custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to modify any part of the code, including the architecture, forward method, and any other relevant parts. The goal is to achieve faster execution times by replacing the PyTorch-built-in Conv1d layer with a custom CUDA kernel implementation. ```
