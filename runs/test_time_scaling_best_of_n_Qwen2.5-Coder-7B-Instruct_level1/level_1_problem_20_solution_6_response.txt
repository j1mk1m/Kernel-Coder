Note: You can use libraries such as `torch.cuda` or `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to create custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to experiment with different approaches to optimize the performance of the LeakyReLU operation. 

Remember to follow best practices when writing CUDA code, including memory alignment, efficient data transfer, and proper synchronization. If you encounter any issues during implementation, feel free to ask for help or suggest alternative solutions.
