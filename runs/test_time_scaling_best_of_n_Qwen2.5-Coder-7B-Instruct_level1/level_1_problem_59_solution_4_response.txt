Please ensure that all the functionality of the original Model class is preserved in the new ModelNew class. Your implementation should be as efficient as possible, taking advantage of CUDA parallelism where applicable. 

**Hint**: Consider optimizing the 3D convolution operation by using specialized CUDA libraries or algorithms that can handle large-scale computations more efficiently. One such library is cuDNN, which provides highly optimized primitives for deep learning operations including convolutions. However, since we are asking for custom CUDA kernels, you should implement a simplified version of the convolution operation tailored to your specific needs.
