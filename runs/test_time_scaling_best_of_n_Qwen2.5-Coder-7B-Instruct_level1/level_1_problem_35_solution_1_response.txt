Your answer should include:

- The `ModelNew` class definition
- The custom CUDA kernel implementation
- The necessary imports at the beginning of the code
- Any additional helper functions or classes if needed
- A brief explanation of any optimizations made

Make sure the code is self-contained and can be executed directly after copying it into a Python environment with PyTorch installed.
