Please note that I would prefer the custom CUDA implementation to be a fused operation if possible. For example, if there are two operations back-to-back, you could fuse them into one kernel if it makes sense. This will help reduce memory bandwidth and improve overall performance. In this case, the HardSigmoid can be fused with another operation if possible.
