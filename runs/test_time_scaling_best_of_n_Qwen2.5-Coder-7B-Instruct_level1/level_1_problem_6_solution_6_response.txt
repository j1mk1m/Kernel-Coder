Here is one possible way to approach the problem:

- Identify the bottleneck operation in the model.
- Replace the bottleneck operation with a custom CUDA kernel.
- If necessary, fuse other operations with the custom kernel.
- Ensure that the custom kernel handles edge cases and maintains numerical stability.
- Verify that the custom kernel produces the same results as the original PyTorch implementation.
- Test the performance improvement using a benchmarking tool.
