Here is a hint for one possible approach to optimizing the given architecture:

- Replace the matrix multiplication operation with a custom CUDA kernel that implements a more efficient algorithm for symmetric matrix multiplication, such as the blocked algorithm or the tiled algorithm. This can significantly reduce the number of operations and improve performance.

- Combine the matrix multiplication operation with other operations, such as element-wise addition or activation functions, into a single kernel. This can further reduce the overhead of calling multiple kernels and improve performance.

- Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory accesses. This can improve cache locality and reduce memory bandwidth usage.

- Use parallel reduction techniques to compute the sum of elements in the output matrix. This can reduce the number of operations and improve performance.

- Implement a custom CUDA kernel that uses fused multiply-add (FMA) instructions to perform matrix multiplication and accumulation in a single step. This can improve performance by reducing the number of instructions executed and improving instruction-level parallelism.

Please provide the optimized code in markdown format.
