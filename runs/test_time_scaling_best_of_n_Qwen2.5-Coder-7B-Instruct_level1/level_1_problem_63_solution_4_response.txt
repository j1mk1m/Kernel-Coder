Here are some tips to help you get started:

- Use PyTorch's `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` to compile your custom CUDA code.
- Make sure your custom CUDA kernel is properly defined and called within your new architecture.
- Consider using shared memory to optimize memory access patterns in your CUDA kernel.
- Ensure that your custom CUDA kernel handles edge cases, such as when the number of elements is not divisible by the block size.
- If necessary, implement additional helper functions to facilitate the execution of your custom CUDA kernel.
- Remember to include any necessary headers at the beginning of your CUDA source code.

Good luck!
