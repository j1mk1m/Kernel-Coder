Please note that the solution should aim to optimize the performance of the Layer Normalization operation using custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to explore different optimization techniques such as fused operations, algorithmic changes, or parallelization strategies. The goal is to achieve significant speedup compared to the PyTorch implementation.
