Here's how I would like the final answer to look like:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Add your custom CUDA kernel definitions here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride=1, padding=0, output_padding=0, groups=1, bias=False):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize any custom CUDA kernels here

    def forward(self, x):
        # Use the custom CUDA kernels in the forward pass
        return x
```

Please provide the full implementation of the `ModelNew` class using custom CUDA kernels where appropriate. Ensure that the `forward` method uses these kernels instead of PyTorch's built-in operations.
```
