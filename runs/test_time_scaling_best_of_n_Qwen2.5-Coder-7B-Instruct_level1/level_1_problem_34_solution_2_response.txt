Please note that the goal here is to optimize the performance of the model, so please provide detailed reasoning for each optimization you make. For example, why did you choose to replace Instance Normalization with a custom CUDA operator? What were the performance improvements you observed? etc. Feel free to experiment with different optimizations and techniques, but ensure that your final implementation is fully functional and produces correct results.

Here's what I would expect to see in your response:

- A detailed explanation of your optimization strategy.
- The code for the new architecture `ModelNew`.
- Performance comparisons between the original and optimized architectures (if possible).
- Any additional insights or lessons learned from the process.

Remember, the key here is to demonstrate how custom CUDA operators can be used to optimize neural network operations and improve performance. Good luck!
