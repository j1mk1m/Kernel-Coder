### Hints:

- Consider optimizing the matrix multiplication using techniques such as blocked matrix multiplication or fused GEMM (General Matrix Multiply).
- If you're comfortable with CUDA programming, you can also explore other optimization techniques such as shared memory usage, coalesced memory access patterns, etc.
- Remember that the goal is to achieve significant speedup over the original PyTorch implementation. Be creative with your approach!

### Expected Output:

The expected output should be a working Python script that defines the `ModelNew` class with the optimized CUDA kernels for matrix multiplication. The script should include all necessary imports and be fully self-contained.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Performance**: The performance improvement over the original PyTorch implementation should be evident when benchmarking both versions.
- **Correctness**: The `ModelNew` class should produce the same output as the original `Model` class for any valid input.
- **Readability**: The code should be well-commented and easy to understand, explaining the optimizations used.
