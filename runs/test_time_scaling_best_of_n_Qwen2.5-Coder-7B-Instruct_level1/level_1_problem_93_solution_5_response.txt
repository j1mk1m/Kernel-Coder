Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Identify the PyTorch operator(s) used in the `forward` method of the `Model` class.
2. Research whether there is a more efficient way to implement these operator(s) using CUDA.
3. Implement the custom CUDA kernel(s) in C++.
4. Load the custom CUDA kernel(s) into PyTorch using `load_inline`.
5. Replace the PyTorch operator(s) with the custom CUDA kernel(s) in the `forward` method of the `ModelNew` class.
6. Ensure that the `ModelNew` class has the same interface as the original `Model` class.
7. Test the `ModelNew` class to ensure it produces the same results as the original `Model` class but runs faster.

Please provide the final code for `ModelNew`. ```python
