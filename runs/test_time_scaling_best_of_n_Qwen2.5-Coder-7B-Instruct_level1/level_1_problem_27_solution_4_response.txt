Please follow the guidelines provided above and optimize the architecture using custom CUDA kernels wherever possible. Consider optimizing both the forward pass and any other relevant parts of the model. 

Your solution should be efficient and take advantage of parallel processing capabilities of GPUs. Remember that PyTorch's built-in operations are highly optimized, so your custom CUDA implementation should provide significant performance improvements.
