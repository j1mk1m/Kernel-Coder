### Requirements:
- Replace `torch.mean` with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Consider using shared memory to improve performance.
- Ensure that the implementation correctly handles edge cases such as empty dimensions or NaN values.
- Your solution should be efficient and handle large batch sizes effectively.

Here is the initial architecture for reference:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Simple model that performs mean reduction over a specific dimension.
    """
    def __init__(self, dim: int):
        """
        Initializes the model with the dimension to reduce over.

        Args:
            dim (int): The dimension to reduce over.
        """
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.dim = dim

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """
        Reduces the input tensor along the specified dimension by taking the mean.

        Args:
            x (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of arbitrary shape.

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: Output tensor with reduced dimension. The shape of the output is the same as the input except for the reduced dimension which is removed.
        """
        return torch.mean(x, dim=self.dim)

batch_size = 128
dim1 = 4096
dim2 = 4095

def get_inputs():
    x = torch.rand(batch_size, dim1, dim2)
    return [x]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [1]
```

Your task is to optimize this architecture by replacing the `torch.mean` operation with a custom CUDA kernel.
