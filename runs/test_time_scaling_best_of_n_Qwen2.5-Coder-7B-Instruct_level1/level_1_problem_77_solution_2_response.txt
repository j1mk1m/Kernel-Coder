Please note that the Model class has a single 3D transposed convolution layer. Replace this layer with a custom CUDA kernel. You can optimize the layer in any way you see fit, including changing the algorithm, fusing operations, etc. Be creative and aim for maximum performance.

Here is a hint on how to approach this problem: 
- Understand the operation performed by the 3D transposed convolution layer.
- Identify potential optimizations, such as parallelizing the computation across threads or blocks.
- Implement the custom CUDA kernel in C++.
- Integrate the custom CUDA kernel into the PyTorch model using `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline`.

Please provide the full implementation of ModelNew. Ensure that the code compiles and runs correctly without errors.
