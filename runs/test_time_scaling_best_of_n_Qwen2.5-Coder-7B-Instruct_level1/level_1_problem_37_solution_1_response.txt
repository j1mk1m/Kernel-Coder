Note: This task requires knowledge of both PyTorch and CUDA programming. It also requires proficiency in understanding mathematical operations such as the Frobenius norm and how they can be efficiently computed using GPU acceleration. Be aware that optimizing a simple operation like Frobenius norm normalization might not yield significant performance improvements due to the overhead of calling a custom CUDA kernel. However, for more complex models and larger datasets, the benefits of custom CUDA kernels can become apparent.
