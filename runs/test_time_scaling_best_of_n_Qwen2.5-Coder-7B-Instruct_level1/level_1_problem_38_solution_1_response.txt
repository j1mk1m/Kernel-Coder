Here are some tips:

- Use PyTorch C++ API to define custom CUDA kernels.
- Consider using fused operations where possible.
- Avoid unnecessary data transfers between CPU and GPU.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernels handle edge cases appropriately.
- Optimize memory usage and parallelism wherever possible.
