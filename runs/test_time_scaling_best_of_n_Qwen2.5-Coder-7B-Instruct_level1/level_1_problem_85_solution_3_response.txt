Note: Feel free to use any CUDA libraries, but ensure that they are available on most systems where PyTorch is installed. Also, keep in mind that the goal is to achieve speedup through custom CUDA kernels, so avoid replacing operations that are already highly optimized by PyTorch. For example, basic arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication can be left as-is unless there's a specific reason to optimize them further.
