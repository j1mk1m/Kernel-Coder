Please note that you should be aware of the limitations of CUDA and try to optimize the most computationally expensive parts of the model. Also, be mindful of memory usage and ensure that the kernel fits within the GPU's memory capacity. Consider using shared memory and coalesced memory access patterns where applicable. Finally, ensure that the custom CUDA kernels maintain the same functionality as the original PyTorch operators.
