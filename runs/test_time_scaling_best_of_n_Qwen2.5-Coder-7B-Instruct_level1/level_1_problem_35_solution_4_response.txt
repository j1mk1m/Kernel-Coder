Hint: Consider using group normalization's underlying operations for optimization. Group normalization can be implemented using batch normalization and a reparameterization trick. Batch normalization involves calculating mean and variance across a channel dimension, which can be parallelized efficiently on GPUs. Additionally, group normalization divides the channels into groups and applies normalization within each group independently, which can also be optimized using custom CUDA kernels. 

For example, instead of calling PyTorch's built-in batch normalization function, you could implement the mean and variance calculations manually in a custom CUDA kernel. Similarly, applying normalization within each group can also be done using custom CUDA kernels. This approach can lead to significant performance improvements on GPUs due to reduced overhead and better memory access patterns.
