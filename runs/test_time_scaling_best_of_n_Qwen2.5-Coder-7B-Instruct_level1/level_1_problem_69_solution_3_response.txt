Please note that it is acceptable to use other PyTorch functions in the forward pass of ModelNew, but avoid using any PyTorch operators that would be replaced by custom CUDA kernels. In other words, if you decide to replace a PyTorch operator with a custom CUDA kernel, do not use that PyTorch operator anywhere else in the forward pass of ModelNew. For example, if you decide to replace the relu() operator with a custom CUDA kernel, do not use the relu() function anywhere else in the forward pass of ModelNew. 

You can assume that all inputs to the forward method of ModelNew will be of type torch.cuda.FloatTensor.
