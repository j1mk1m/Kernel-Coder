Here are some tips to help you get started:

- Consider optimizing the `torch.cumsum` operation, as it can be computationally expensive when dealing with large tensors.
- Explore alternative algorithms or data structures that could potentially offer better performance.
- Think about how you can parallelize the computation using CUDA.
- Remember that you can define custom CUDA kernels and integrate them into PyTorch using `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline`.

Please provide a detailed explanation of your optimization approach in your answer.
