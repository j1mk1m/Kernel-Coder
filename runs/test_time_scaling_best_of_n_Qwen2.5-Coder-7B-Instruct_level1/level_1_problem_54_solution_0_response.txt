The goal is to optimize the performance of the Model class by replacing the standard PyTorch operations with custom CUDA kernels when possible. Feel free to modify the architecture as needed to achieve this goal. For example, you can change the order of operations, combine multiple operations into a single kernel, use alternative algorithms, etc. The key is to improve the performance of the Model class using custom CUDA operators.
