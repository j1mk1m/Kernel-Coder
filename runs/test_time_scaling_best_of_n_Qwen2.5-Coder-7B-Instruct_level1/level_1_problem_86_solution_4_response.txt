Please ensure that all CUDA kernels are well-commented and follow best practices for performance optimization. Include error checking where necessary. 

Here is a template for how you might structure your answer:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Custom CUDA kernel definitions here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, dilation, bias):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize any custom CUDA operators here
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement the forward pass using custom CUDA operators
        pass
```

Remember to compile the CUDA kernels and integrate them into your PyTorch model. Ensure that the model behaves exactly as the original Model but runs faster due to the use of custom CUDA operators.
