Your solution should include at least one custom CUDA kernel and potentially more depending on your optimization strategy. Feel free to optimize any part of the architecture that you see fit, but prioritize optimizing the 2D transposed convolution operation. Consider operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or other techniques to improve performance.
