Here is how you would use the new architecture:

```python
def main():
    model_new = ModelNew(alpha=get_init_inputs()[0])
    inputs = get_inputs()
    outputs = model_new(inputs[0])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that you should also provide a brief explanation of why you chose certain operators to optimize and any performance improvements you expect from these optimizations.
