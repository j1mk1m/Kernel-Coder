Please note that it is acceptable to use any PyTorch operations that are not implemented in CUDA, but you must implement any PyTorch operations that are used in the `forward` method of the `Model` class using CUDA. In other words, if the `forward` method uses a PyTorch operation that is not implemented in CUDA, you must provide a custom CUDA implementation for that operation. You are allowed to use any PyTorch operations that are not implemented in CUDA, but you must provide a custom CUDA implementation for any PyTorch operations that are used in the `forward` method of the `Model` class.
