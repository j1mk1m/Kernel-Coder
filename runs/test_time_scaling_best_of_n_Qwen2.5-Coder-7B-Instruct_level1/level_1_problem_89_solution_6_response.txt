### Constraints:

- Your solution must be written in Python using PyTorch.
- Only use standard PyTorch libraries and extensions.
- Ensure that all operations within the new architecture are either implemented in CUDA or directly supported by PyTorch without any overhead.
- The new architecture should maintain the functionality of the original model while potentially improving performance.
- Feel free to modify the architecture as needed to achieve the best performance.
