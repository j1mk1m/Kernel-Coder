The resulting ModelNew should perform the same computation as the original Model but potentially faster due to custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to replace any number of operations with custom CUDA kernels, including fusing multiple operations together. For example, you might choose to fuse the convolution and activation into a single kernel. Be creative and optimize for performance.
