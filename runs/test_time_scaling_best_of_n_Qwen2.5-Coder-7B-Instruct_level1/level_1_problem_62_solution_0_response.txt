Please note that you should aim for maximum performance improvement while maintaining correctness. Feel free to experiment with different kernel designs, memory access patterns, etc. You can also use cuBLAS, cuDNN, or other libraries to further optimize your implementation. However, please ensure that any external dependencies are clearly stated and included in your solution.
