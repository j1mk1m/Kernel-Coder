Here are the steps to follow:

1. Understand the original model architecture.
2. Identify potential candidates for custom CUDA kernels.
3. Write custom CUDA kernels for these candidates.
4. Replace the corresponding PyTorch operators with the custom CUDA kernels.
5. Ensure the new architecture maintains the same functionality as the original model.
6. Test the new architecture with the provided inputs.

Please provide the final implementation of `ModelNew` class in the specified format.
