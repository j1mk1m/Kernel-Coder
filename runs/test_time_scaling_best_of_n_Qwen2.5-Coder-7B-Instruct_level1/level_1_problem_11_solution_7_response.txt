Your answer should be a solution that optimizes the 4D tensor-matrix multiplication operation using a custom CUDA kernel. This could involve implementing the operation manually, optimizing the existing PyTorch implementation, or both. Be creative and consider algorithmic improvements as well as parallelization techniques. ```python
