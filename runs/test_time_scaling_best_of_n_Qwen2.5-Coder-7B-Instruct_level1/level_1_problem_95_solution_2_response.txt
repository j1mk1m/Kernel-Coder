### Constraints:

- Only use CUDA for the optimization.
- Do not modify the `get_inputs()` and `get_init_inputs()` functions.
- Ensure the outputted model (`ModelNew`) has the same functionality as the original model (`Model`).
- Use the `load_inline` function from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile the CUDA code.
- Your solution should be efficient in terms of both time and memory usage.
