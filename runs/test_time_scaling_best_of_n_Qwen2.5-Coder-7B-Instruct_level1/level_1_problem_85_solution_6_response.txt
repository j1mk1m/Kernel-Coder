### Requirements:
- Use at least one custom CUDA kernel to optimize the performance of the model.
- Consider operator fusion opportunities if applicable.
- Ensure that the optimized architecture maintains the same functionality as the original architecture.
- Provide comments in your code to explain any changes made.
