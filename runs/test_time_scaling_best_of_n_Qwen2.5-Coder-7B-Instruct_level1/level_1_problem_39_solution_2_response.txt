The goal is to optimize the `forward` method of the `Model` class using custom CUDA operators to achieve better performance. You can choose any subset of operations within the `forward` method to replace with custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to introduce additional helper functions or classes if needed. The final output should be a new architecture `ModelNew` that inherits from `nn.Module` and implements the optimized `forward` method. Make sure to include all necessary imports at the beginning of the code snippet. ```python
