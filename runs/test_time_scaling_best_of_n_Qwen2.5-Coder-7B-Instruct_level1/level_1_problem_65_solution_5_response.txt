### Requirements:
- You must provide a full implementation of ModelNew that can be used directly.
- The implementation should leverage custom CUDA kernels where appropriate.
- The custom CUDA kernels should be efficient and well-optimized.
- The final implementation should maintain the same functionality as the original Model.
- Feel free to experiment with different optimizations, such as operator fusion or algorithmic improvements.
