Please note that your solution should focus on optimizing the performance of the matrix multiplication operation (`torch.matmul`) used within the `forward` method of the `Model`. Feel free to explore any techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or custom CUDA kernels that could potentially lead to significant speedup. However, keep in mind that the goal is to maintain the functionality of the original model while improving its performance.
