Here's a hint about how to approach this task:

- Identify the operation that can be optimized using CUDA. In this case, it's the `min` reduction operation.
- Write a custom CUDA kernel for the `min` reduction operation.
- Replace the PyTorch `min` operation with the custom CUDA kernel in the `forward` method of the `Model` class.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel correctly handles the reduction over the specified dimension.
- Compile and test the new architecture to ensure it produces the correct results and has improved performance compared to the original architecture.
