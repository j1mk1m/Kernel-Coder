Your solution should include at least one custom CUDA operator that replaces a PyTorch operator. Feel free to add additional operators or combine them as needed to achieve performance improvements.

Here is the original code without comments:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=1000):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=96, kernel_size=11, stride=4, padding=2)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        return x

def get_inputs():
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, 3, 224, 224)]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [num_classes]
```

```python
batch_size = 256
num_classes = 1000
```

Please provide the optimized version of `Model` named `ModelNew`. Make sure the code is efficient and follows best practices for CUDA optimization.
