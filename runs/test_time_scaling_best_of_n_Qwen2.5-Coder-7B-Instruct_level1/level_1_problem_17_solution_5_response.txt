Your custom CUDA kernel should be designed to handle large matrices efficiently, taking advantage of parallelism available on GPUs. Consider using shared memory if appropriate, and optimizing the kernel launch parameters (grid and block sizes) for maximum performance. If possible, also explore algorithmic optimizations such as fused operations (e.g., GEMM + relu) or alternative algorithms for computing matrix multiplications (e.g., batched GEMM). Feel free to experiment with different approaches and compare their performance.
