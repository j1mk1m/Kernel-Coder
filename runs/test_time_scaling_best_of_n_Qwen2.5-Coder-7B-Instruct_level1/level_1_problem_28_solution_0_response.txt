The optimized code should be in python and use the syntax provided in the example. Use the `load_inline` function from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile the CUDA code. Make sure to include all necessary imports and define the CUDA kernel for the HardSigmoid operation. Provide the optimized architecture in the form of a class called `ModelNew`. ```python
