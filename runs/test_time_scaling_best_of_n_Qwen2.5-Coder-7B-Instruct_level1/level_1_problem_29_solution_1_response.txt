The goal here is to replace the softplus operator with a custom CUDA kernel implementation. If you feel there are other operators that can be improved, feel free to do so. But the primary focus should be on optimizing the softplus operation. Feel free to use PyTorch C++ extensions to implement the custom CUDA kernel.
