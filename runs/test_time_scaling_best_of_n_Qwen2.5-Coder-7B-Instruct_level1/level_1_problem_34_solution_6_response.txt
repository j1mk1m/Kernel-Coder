Note: Feel free to experiment with different operators to optimize performance. For instance, you could potentially use a custom implementation of Instance Normalization using CUDA, which might be faster than PyTorch's built-in function. However, be aware that implementing Instance Normalization from scratch can be complex and time-consuming. If you decide to implement it, please ensure that your implementation is correct and efficient. Additionally, consider whether there are other operations in the architecture that could also benefit from custom CUDA implementations.
