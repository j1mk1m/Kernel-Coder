### Constraints:
- You can only use PyTorch and CUDA.
- You cannot change the method signature of any function.
- Your solution should aim to maximize performance while maintaining correctness.
- Ensure that the output architecture `ModelNew` has the same functionality as `Model`.

### Deliverables:
- A new Python class `ModelNew` that implements the optimized architecture using custom CUDA operators.
- The new implementation should be efficient and utilize CUDA for acceleration.

### Tips:
- Consider optimizing the convolution operation, which is a common bottleneck in neural networks.
- Think about algorithmic optimizations such as grouped convolutions or online convolution algorithms.
- Be mindful of memory access patterns and ensure they are coalesced for optimal performance.
- You can use libraries like cuDNN for further optimization, but ensure it aligns with your requirements.
