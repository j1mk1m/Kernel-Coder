The new code should be optimized for speed by replacing certain operations with custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to optimize any part of the architecture that could benefit from a speedup. For example, you can replace the entire transposed convolution operation with a custom CUDA kernel, or you can replace parts of the operation with custom CUDA kernels. Be creative and optimize the architecture for speed. Make sure the optimized architecture still produces the same output as the original architecture. ```
