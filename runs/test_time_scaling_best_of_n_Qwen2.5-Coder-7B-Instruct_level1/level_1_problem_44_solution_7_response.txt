Here's how you can approach this:

1. Analyze the operations performed by the `Model` class.
2. Identify which operations can be optimized using custom CUDA kernels.
3. Implement the custom CUDA kernels.
4. Replace the corresponding PyTorch operations with the custom CUDA kernels in the `ModelNew` class.
5. Ensure that the new architecture maintains the same functionality as the original one.

Remember to follow the guidelines provided in the example and ensure that the solution is efficient and well-optimized.
