Please note that your implementation should aim to optimize the performance of the depthwise 2D convolution operation. Feel free to modify any part of the code to achieve this goal. You may also add additional helper functions or classes as needed. However, ensure that the overall structure and functionality of the model remain intact. 

Here's a hint: You can use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency and improve the performance of the convolution operation. Additionally, you can explore different algorithms such as grouped convolution to further optimize the performance.
