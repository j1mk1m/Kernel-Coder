Note: This question is asking you to use your knowledge of CUDA and PyTorch to optimize the given model. You should aim to achieve significant speedup compared to the original implementation. Feel free to make any assumptions about the input data and the hardware environment. 

Also note that you can't use PyTorch's built-in CUDA operators for this task, you must implement everything from scratch using CUDA. You are encouraged to experiment with different algorithms and techniques to achieve the best performance. 

Remember to include all necessary imports at the beginning of your code. Your solution should be as efficient as possible, both in terms of computational complexity and memory usage.
