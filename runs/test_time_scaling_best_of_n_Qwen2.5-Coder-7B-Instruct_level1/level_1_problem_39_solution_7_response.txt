Your solution should optimize at least one operation in the original architecture, and it can be any of the operations performed within the `forward` method. Feel free to use any PyTorch APIs or CUDA features to achieve optimization. If possible, aim to implement fused operations or algorithmic optimizations that could lead to significant performance improvements.
