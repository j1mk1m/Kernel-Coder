The code should be well-commented and explain the reasoning behind each change you made. Feel free to use any libraries or tools that you deem necessary to achieve the optimization.

### Constraints:

- You must use PyTorch's C++ extension capabilities (`torch.utils.cpp_extension`) to define and compile custom CUDA kernels.
- You can only modify the `forward` method of the `Model` class to implement your custom CUDA kernels.
- You cannot change the class definition or constructor of the `Model` class.
- You must provide a detailed explanation of why you chose to optimize certain operations and how it improves performance.

### Note:

- The provided code is just an example. Your solution should be tailored to the specific requirements of the `Model` class.
- Feel free to experiment with different algorithms, data layouts, and optimization techniques to achieve the best possible performance.
- The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of PyTorch's C++ extension capabilities and your ability to implement efficient custom CUDA kernels.
