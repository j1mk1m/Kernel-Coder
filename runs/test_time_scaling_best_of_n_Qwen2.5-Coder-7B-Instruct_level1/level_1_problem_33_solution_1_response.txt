Please ensure that all necessary imports are included at the beginning of the code snippet and that the function `get_init_inputs()` returns the correct input parameters for initializing the model. The `get_inputs()` function should still return valid inputs for the optimized model. 

The solution should be efficient and demonstrate improvements over the original model in terms of execution time. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of operators to achieve the best performance.
