The solution should optimize performance specifically for the 3D convolution operation. Consider using techniques such as shared memory, coalesced memory access patterns, and other optimizations specific to CUDA. 

Also, feel free to use any other optimization techniques that can help improve the performance of the 3D convolution operation, such as algorithmic changes, operator fusion, etc. 

Please ensure that the custom CUDA operator replaces the existing PyTorch operator and provides a performance improvement when used in the context of the provided test code. 

Note: You do not need to include the get_inputs() and get_init_inputs() functions in your answer. Only provide the optimized architecture named ModelNew. ```
