Please provide the new architecture using the same syntax as the example provided. 

The optimization should aim to improve performance by replacing the existing PyTorch operator with a custom CUDA implementation. Consider operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or any other method to enhance performance. Ensure that the functionality remains the same as the original architecture.
