### Constraints:

- Only use custom CUDA operators for optimization purposes, do not change the functionality of the model.
- Ensure the resulting architecture maintains the same behavior as the original architecture.
- Optimize the mean reduction operation using a custom CUDA kernel. Consider algorithmic improvements such as parallelizing the reduction across threads or blocks.
- If necessary, combine the mean reduction operation with other operations to further optimize performance.
- Use PyTorch's `load_inline` function to compile and load the custom CUDA kernel.
