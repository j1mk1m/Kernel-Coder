Please follow these guidelines:
- Use custom CUDA kernels to optimize the transposed 1D convolution operation.
- Feel free to add any additional helper functions or classes as needed.
- Ensure that the optimized ModelNew class can be instantiated and used just like the original Model class.
- The output should be self-contained and include all necessary imports.
