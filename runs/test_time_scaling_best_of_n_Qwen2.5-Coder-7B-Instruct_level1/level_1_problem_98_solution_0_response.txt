The optimization should be done using CUDA to accelerate the computation of KL divergence. Consider the following approaches:

- Implementing the KL divergence calculation manually using CUDA.
- Using fused operations to reduce memory bandwidth usage.
- Employing efficient data layout for better cache utilization.
- Utilizing parallel processing to maximize GPU utilization.
- Any other approach that leverages CUDA capabilities to improve performance.

Your goal is to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining correctness. Provide a detailed explanation of your optimizations in the comments within the code.
