Here's how you can start:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline
```

Remember to define the custom CUDA kernel and compile it using `load_inline`. Then, create a new class `ModelNew` that uses the custom CUDA kernel in its `forward` method. Make sure to handle the same inputs and outputs as the original `Model`.

Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel performs the sum reduction operation efficiently. You may need to adjust the kernel parameters or implement additional optimizations to achieve the desired performance improvement.
