Please note that the goal is to optimize the `forward` method of the `Model` class. You can modify the entire class definition if needed. Feel free to use any CUDA optimization techniques such as grid-stride loops, shared memory, etc. but ensure the code remains readable and maintainable.

```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim: int):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.dim = dim

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Your implementation here
        pass
```

Please provide a detailed explanation of your optimizations and how they improve performance.
