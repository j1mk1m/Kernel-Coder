Your custom CUDA kernel should be able to perform the transposed 2D convolution operation efficiently. Feel free to modify the architecture and add any additional components needed to achieve the goal. Ensure that the overall functionality remains the same as the original architecture. 

The solution should aim to leverage CUDA parallelism to maximize performance. Be sure to include appropriate error checking and handle cases where inputs do not meet the expected dimensions or types. ```
