Please provide the optimized code for ModelNew using custom CUDA operators for the Frobenius norm normalization operation. Make sure the code is efficient and leverages CUDA parallelism where appropriate. If necessary, combine multiple operations into a single kernel or use more advanced algorithms to achieve better performance.
