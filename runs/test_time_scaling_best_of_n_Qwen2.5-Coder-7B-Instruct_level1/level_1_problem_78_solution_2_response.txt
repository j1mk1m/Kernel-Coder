Please note that you should focus on optimizing the performance of the 2D transposed convolution operation, which can be computationally expensive. Feel free to explore different optimization techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or even using more efficient data layouts. The goal is to achieve significant speedup compared to the original implementation.
