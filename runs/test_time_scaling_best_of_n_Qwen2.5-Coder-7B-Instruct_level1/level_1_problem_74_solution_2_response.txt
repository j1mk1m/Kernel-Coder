Please note that the goal is to achieve the best performance possible using custom CUDA kernels. You should focus on optimizing the transposed 1D convolution operation, which is the main computational bottleneck in this architecture. Feel free to experiment with different algorithms and techniques to improve performance. Your solution should be efficient and scalable, capable of handling large batch sizes and input lengths.
