### Constraints:
- Only use PyTorch and CUDA, no other libraries.
- The resulting architecture should be fully compatible with the provided test code.
- Your solution must optimize the convolution operation using a custom CUDA kernel.
- You can modify any part of the provided code, including the class definition, method definitions, and helper functions.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel is efficient and correctly implements the convolution operation.
- The resulting architecture should maintain the same functionality as the original Model but potentially with improved performance due to the custom CUDA implementation.
