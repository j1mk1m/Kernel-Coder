### Guidelines:
- You can use any PyTorch operators.
- You must use custom CUDA kernels for at least one operation.
- Consider using CUDA-specific features such as shared memory, texture memory, etc., to optimize performance.
- Your implementation should be able to handle large matrices efficiently.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel is correctly integrated into the PyTorch model.
- Avoid unnecessary copies of data between CPU and GPU.
- If possible, fuse multiple operations into a single kernel for better efficiency.
- Document any assumptions or limitations of your implementation.
