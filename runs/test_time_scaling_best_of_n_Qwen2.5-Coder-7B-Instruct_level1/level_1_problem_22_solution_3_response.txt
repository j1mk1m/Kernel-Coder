Here is the reference solution using PyTorch's built-in Tanh function:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Simple model that performs a Tanh activation.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
    
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """
        Applies Tanh activation to the input tensor.

        Args:
            x (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of any shape.

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: Output tensor with Tanh applied, same shape as input.
        """
        return torch.tanh(x)

batch_size = 4096
dim = 393216

def get_inputs():
    x = torch.rand(batch_size, dim)
    return [x]

def get_init_inputs():
    return []  # No special initialization inputs needed
```

Your task is to optimize the above architecture using custom CUDA operators. Make sure to follow the guidelines provided. To verify correctness, you can compare the outputs of `Model` and `ModelNew` with the same inputs. They should be identical. Your solution should aim to improve performance through custom CUDA kernels.
