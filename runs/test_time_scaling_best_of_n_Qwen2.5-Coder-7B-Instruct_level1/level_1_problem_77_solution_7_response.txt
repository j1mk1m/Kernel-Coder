Here's how you might approach it:

- Identify potential bottlenecks or operations that could benefit from custom CUDA implementations.
- Choose which operations to implement as custom CUDA kernels.
- Write the CUDA kernel(s) in C++.
- Use PyTorch's `load_inline` function to compile and link the CUDA code within your Python script.
- Replace the original PyTorch operators with your custom CUDA implementations in the `forward` method of `ModelNew`.

Please provide the complete implementation of `ModelNew`. ```python
