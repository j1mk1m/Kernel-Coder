### Constraints:
- Your solution should aim to improve performance by utilizing GPU acceleration.
- Feel free to replace any operations with custom CUDA kernels, including but not limited to matrix-matrix multiplication, element-wise operations, activation functions, etc.
- Ensure that the final implementation matches the original functionality of the `Model` class.
- Optimize for both memory usage and computational efficiency.
