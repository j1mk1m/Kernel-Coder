Please ensure your custom CUDA kernels are well-optimized and take advantage of GPU parallelism. For instance, use shared memory where appropriate, avoid bank conflicts, and optimize thread/block sizes for maximum efficiency. If you decide to implement fused operations, ensure they are efficient and correct.
