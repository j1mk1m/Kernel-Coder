Please note that you should use the `load_inline` function from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile and load the CUDA kernel. You should also define the CUDA kernel within the Python script using string literals, similar to the example provided. Make sure to include any necessary headers and CUDA runtime calls within the kernel definition. Your goal is to optimize the `forward` method of the `Model` class by replacing the PyTorch max reduction operation with a custom CUDA kernel. The kernel should perform the same functionality but be executed on the GPU for potential speedup.
