Please note that you should aim to optimize the performance of the model, but also ensure that the code remains readable and maintainable. Consider algorithmic improvements, such as using more efficient memory layouts, avoiding unnecessary copies, and optimizing data flow. If you decide to implement custom CUDA kernels, make sure to provide a detailed explanation of why each kernel is necessary and how it improves the overall performance of the model.
