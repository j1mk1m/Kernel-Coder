Make sure that all parameters of the original Model class are preserved in the ModelNew class. Ensure that the behavior of the model remains consistent after optimization. You should be able to run the same test code with ModelNew without any modifications. 

The goal is to optimize the performance of the model using custom CUDA operators. You can choose to optimize any part of the model that you think will benefit from custom CUDA implementations. You can also combine multiple operations into a single kernel if it makes sense.

Note: You do not need to worry about memory allocation, deallocation, or data transfer between CPU and GPU. Assume that all data is already on the GPU when the forward method is called.

Here's how the final result should look:

```python
# Your optimized code here
```

Please provide the optimized code in the specified format.
