### Requirements:

- The custom CUDA kernel should be implemented in C++ and CUDA.
- The kernel should be loaded using `load_inline` from `torch.utils.cpp_extension`.
- The `forward` method of `ModelNew` should use the custom CUDA kernel instead of PyTorch's built-in L2 normalization.
- The custom CUDA kernel should perform the L2 normalization operation efficiently.
- The code should compile and run without errors.
