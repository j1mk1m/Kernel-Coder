Please ensure your custom CUDA kernels are well-documented and follow best practices. Include comments explaining the purpose of each function and any relevant details about the implementation. 

Please also include any necessary imports at the beginning of your code. If you use any external libraries, please mention them in the comments. 

Remember, the goal is to optimize the performance of the model using custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to experiment with different approaches and algorithms to achieve the best possible speedup. Good luck!
