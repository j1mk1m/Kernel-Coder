Please ensure that the architecture `ModelNew` is completely different from `Model`, meaning it should use different CUDA kernels for at least one of the operations.

Your latest generated kernel:
```
error: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
