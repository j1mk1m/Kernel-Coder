Your latest generated kernel:
```
RuntimeError: expected 4-dimensional input (got 3-dimensional input)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```


Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Improve upon your previous attempts by debugging any correctness issues or improving the efficiency if the kernel was correct.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
