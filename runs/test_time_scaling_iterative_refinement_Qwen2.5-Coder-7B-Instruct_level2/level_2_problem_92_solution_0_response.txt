Please follow these steps:

1. Identify which operators can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels.
2. Implement those operators using CUDA kernels.
3. Replace the original PyTorch operators with your custom CUDA kernels.
4. Ensure that the new architecture still produces the same output as the original one.

Make sure that your custom CUDA kernels are efficient and well-optimized. Consider operator fusion and other optimization techniques to improve performance.
