The goal is to optimize the given architecture by replacing some of its operators with custom CUDA kernels to achieve speedups.

Please note that you can use PyTorch's `load_inline` function to compile and link the CUDA code directly within Python. Make sure to include all necessary imports and define any helper functions or classes needed to implement your custom CUDA kernels. 

Ensure that the `ModelNew` class maintains the same functionality as the original `Model` class but achieves better performance through the use of custom CUDA operators.
