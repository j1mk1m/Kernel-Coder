```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Please provide the corrected and fully functional code for the optimized architecture ModelNew with the appropriate CUDA kernel. Make sure that the kernel correctly implements the operations and matches the behavior of the original PyTorch implementation.
