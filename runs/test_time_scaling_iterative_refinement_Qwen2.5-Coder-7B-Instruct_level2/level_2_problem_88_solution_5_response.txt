Your latest generated kernel:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Please note that you should focus on optimizing the performance of the model, not just correctness. You can choose to optimize one or more of the operations in the forward pass, such as the GEMM, GroupNorm, Multiply, or Swish operations. You can also choose to implement the entire forward pass using custom CUDA operators if you wish.

Please provide the updated code for the ModelNew class and the corresponding CUDA kernel source code. Make sure that the code compiles and runs correctly on a GPU.
