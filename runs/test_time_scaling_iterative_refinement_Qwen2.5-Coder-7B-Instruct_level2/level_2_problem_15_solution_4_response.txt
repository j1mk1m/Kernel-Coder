Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid decimal literal (<string>, line 3)

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Complete the optimization process and ensure everything is working as expected. Fix any last-minute issues and optimize further if needed.
