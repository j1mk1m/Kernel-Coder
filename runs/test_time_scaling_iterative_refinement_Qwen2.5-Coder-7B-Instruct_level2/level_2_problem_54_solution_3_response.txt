Your latest generated kernel:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Ensure that the generated kernel does not contain any invalid syntax errors. Make sure the kernel compiles and runs correctly on a GPU. Additionally, verify that the output of the ModelNew architecture matches the output of the original Model architecture when run on the same inputs.

Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
