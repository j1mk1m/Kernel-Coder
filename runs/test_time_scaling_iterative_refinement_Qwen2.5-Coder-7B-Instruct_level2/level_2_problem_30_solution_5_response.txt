Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel for the GEMM operation is implemented correctly and efficiently. Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency. Additionally, optimize the Group Normalization and HardTanh operations as well. Ensure that the optimized architecture maintains the same functionality as the original Model. Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
