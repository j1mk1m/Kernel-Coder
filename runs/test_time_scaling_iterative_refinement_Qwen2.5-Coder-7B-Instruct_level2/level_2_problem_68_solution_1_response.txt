Your latest generated kernel:
```
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the CUDA source code
cuda_source = """
// Your CUDA source code here
"""

# Compile and load the CUDA extension
my_cuda_ext = load_inline(name="my_cuda_ext", cuda_sources=cuda_source, functions=["my_cuda_function"])
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
