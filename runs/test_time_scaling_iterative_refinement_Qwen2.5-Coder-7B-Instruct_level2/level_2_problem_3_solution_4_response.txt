Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Ensure that your implementation is free of syntax errors and correctly implements the functionality of the original architecture. Additionally, aim to achieve performance improvements over the original architecture where possible. If no performance improvement can be achieved, ensure that the implementation remains accurate and efficient.

Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
