Your latest generated kernel:
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your custom CUDA kernel code goes here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    # Your implementation goes here

# Example usage:
# inputs = get_inputs()
# model = ModelNew(*get_init_inputs())
# outputs = model(inputs[0])
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
