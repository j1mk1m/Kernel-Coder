### Guidelines:
- Replace any operator you think will benefit from a custom CUDA implementation.
- Feel free to fuse operators together.
- Consider algorithmic optimizations such as using more efficient activation functions or methods to compute min/max values.
- Ensure that the resulting `ModelNew` class maintains the same functionality as the original `Model`.
- Use the provided `get_inputs()` and `get_init_inputs()` functions to test your implementation.

### Example:
If you decide to replace the `nn.functional.gelu` operator with a custom CUDA implementation, ensure that the `forward` method still correctly computes the output of the model after applying the new GELU implementation.
