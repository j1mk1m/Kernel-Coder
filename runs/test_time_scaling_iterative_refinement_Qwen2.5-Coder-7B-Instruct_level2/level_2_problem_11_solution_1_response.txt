Your latest generated kernel:
```
def get_inputs():
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, in_channels, height, width)]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, groups, num_groups]
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
error: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```


Please debug and optimize further until there are no errors and the architecture works correctly. Provide the final working code in the next response.
