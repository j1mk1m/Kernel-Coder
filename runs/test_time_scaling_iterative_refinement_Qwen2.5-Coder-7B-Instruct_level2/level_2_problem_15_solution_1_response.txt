Your latest generated kernel:
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your custom CUDA kernels here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    # Your implementation here

# Don't change these functions
def get_inputs():
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, in_channels, depth, height, width)]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding]
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
expected an indented block after class definition on line 10 (<string>, line 14)
```

Please note that I am looking for a well-implemented solution with proper indentation and error handling. If there are any errors or missing parts in the provided code, please address them before submitting the final version.
