Please provide a detailed explanation of the optimizations made in your latest version compared to the previous versions. 
Include details about the specific CUDA operations used, how they were implemented, and why these choices were made. Additionally, discuss any performance improvements observed during the evaluation process. 

Your latest generated kernel:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Continuing from the last attempt, debug any remaining issues related to correctness or performance. Make further optimizations if possible.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
