Please note that there could be multiple valid solutions to this problem. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of operations and optimization techniques. Your solution should aim to maximize performance while maintaining correctness. 

Here is your latest generated kernel:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Please ensure that your code is well-documented and follows best practices for CUDA programming. This includes proper memory management, error checking, and efficient use of parallelism. If you encounter any issues during implementation, feel free to ask for assistance. Good luck!
