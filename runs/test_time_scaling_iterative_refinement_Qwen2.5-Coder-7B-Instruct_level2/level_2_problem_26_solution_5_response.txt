Please note that you can use any CUDA features such as shared memory, coalesced memory access patterns, and other optimization techniques to improve performance. Additionally, you can fuse multiple operations into a single kernel to reduce the overhead of launching multiple kernels. Make sure to profile your kernels using tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems or PyTorch Profiler to identify bottlenecks and optimize further.
