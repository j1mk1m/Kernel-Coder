### Note:
- Your solution should aim to optimize the entire workflow of the `Model` class.
- Feel free to combine multiple operations into a single kernel or use different strategies to achieve better performance.
- Make sure to include all necessary imports at the beginning of your code.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define custom CUDA kernels here...

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, scaling_factor, bias_shape, pool_kernel_size):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize any custom CUDA kernels or other components here...

    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement the forward pass using custom CUDA kernels...
        pass

# Example usage:
model_new = ModelNew(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, scaling_factor, bias_shape, pool_kernel_size)
input_tensor = get_inputs()[0].cuda()
output_tensor = model_new(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape)
```

Your task is to replace parts of the existing PyTorch operations with efficient custom CUDA kernels to potentially improve the model's performance.
