Your latest generated kernel:
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define custom CUDA kernels here...

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, scaling_factor, bias_shape, pool_kernel_size):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize any custom CUDA kernels or other components here...

    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement the forward pass using custom CUDA kernels...
        pass

# Example usage:
model_new = ModelNew(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, scaling_factor, bias_shape, pool_kernel_size)
input_tensor = get_inputs()[0].cuda()
output_tensor = model_new(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
name 'in_channels' is not defined
