Make sure the kernel works correctly and does not throw errors when run on the GPU. If it throws errors, debug them and fix them before submitting. Make sure the architecture ModelNew matches the functionality of the original architecture Model exactly. If there are discrepancies, debug them and fix them before submitting.

Ensure that all operations within the ModelNew architecture are performed using CUDA operators where possible to achieve maximum performance. If an operation cannot be performed using a CUDA operator, ensure that it is implemented using PyTorch's built-in operators.

If the kernel still fails, please provide detailed error messages and explanations of how you attempted to debug the issue. This will help us understand the problem better and improve our future responses.

Please note that we expect a well-documented solution that includes clear explanations of why certain choices were made and what steps were taken to optimize the architecture.

Let's try again:

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Debug and correct any issues with the previous attempts.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
