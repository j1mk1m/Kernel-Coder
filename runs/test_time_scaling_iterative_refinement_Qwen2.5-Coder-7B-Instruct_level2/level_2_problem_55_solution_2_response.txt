Please ensure that the custom CUDA kernel correctly implements the operations specified in the original PyTorch model. Your solution should be efficient and maintain the same functionality as the original model.

Your latest generated kernel:
```
error: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel were evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
