Your latest generated kernel:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```

```


Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Make improvements based on feedback and ensure that the new implementation is correct and efficient.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
