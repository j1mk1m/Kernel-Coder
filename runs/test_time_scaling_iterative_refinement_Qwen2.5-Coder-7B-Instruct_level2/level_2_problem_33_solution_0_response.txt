Here are some guidelines for optimization:

1. Replace the GEMM operation with a custom CUDA kernel. If possible, combine it with other operations such as scaling or batch normalization within the same kernel.

2. Implement the scaling operation using a custom CUDA kernel if necessary.

3. Consider implementing batch normalization using a custom CUDA kernel for potential speedup. Note that PyTorch's `BatchNorm1d` might already be optimized, so this step is optional but encouraged if you can demonstrate significant performance improvements.

4. Feel free to add any additional helper functions or classes needed to achieve the optimization.

5. Ensure that the final architecture (`ModelNew`) maintains the same functionality as the original `Model`.

Please provide the optimized code for `ModelNew`.
