### Requirements:

- Replace `nn.Conv2d` with a custom CUDA kernel that implements the same functionality.
- Replace `nn.AvgPool2d` with a custom CUDA kernel that implements the same functionality.
- Replace `torch.sigmoid` with a custom CUDA kernel that implements the same functionality.
- Replace `torch.sum` with a custom CUDA kernel that implements the same functionality.

Ensure that the new architecture `ModelNew` produces the same output as the original `Model` when run with the provided inputs. ```
