Make sure to follow these guidelines:
- Choose which PyTorch operations to replace with custom CUDA kernels.
- Implement operator fusion if possible.
- Optimize algorithms where applicable.
- Ensure the custom CUDA kernels are correctly implemented and tested against the original PyTorch operations.

Please provide the corrected and optimized code for ModelNew.
