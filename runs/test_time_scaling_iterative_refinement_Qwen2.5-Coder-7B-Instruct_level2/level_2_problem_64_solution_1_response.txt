Your latest generated kernel:
```
# Detailed Performance Metrics

# Example of speedup measurements
speedup = original_time / new_time
print(f"Speedup: {speedup}x")
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
name 'original_time' is not defined
```

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Further improve upon your previous attempts by addressing any performance bottlenecks or correctness issues identified during evaluation.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Continuously refine your implementation until it meets or exceeds the performance requirements.
