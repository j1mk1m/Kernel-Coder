Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Make sure to handle edge cases such as batch sizes that are not multiples of the block size in your CUDA kernel. Ensure that your kernel correctly handles all possible inputs without errors.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Ensure that your kernel is memory efficient and avoids unnecessary data transfers between the CPU and GPU. Consider using shared memory within your kernel if it can significantly improve performance.
