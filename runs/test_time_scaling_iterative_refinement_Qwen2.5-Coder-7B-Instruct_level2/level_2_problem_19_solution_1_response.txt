Your latest generated kernel:
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your custom CUDA kernels here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, groups, num_groups):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize your custom layers here

    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement your custom forward pass here
        return x
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
Output shape mismatch: Expected torch.Size([128, 64, 258, 258]), got torch.Size([128, 64, 256, 256])
```

Please provide the corrected version of your ModelNew architecture and kernel. Ensure it matches the expected output shape. ```python
