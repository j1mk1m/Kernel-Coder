Your latest generated kernel:

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```

```

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Debug any correctness issues or improve the efficiency if the kernel was correct. If there were no issues, provide additional optimizations.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.

Please note that you should not just copy-paste the same code again without improvements. Each attempt should build upon the previous one and demonstrate progress towards optimization. If you encounter errors, please include the error message and explain how you plan to fix it.
