Here are some tips to help you:

- Use PyTorch’s `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` function to compile and load the CUDA extension.
- Write CUDA kernels that perform efficient computations.
- Consider operator fusion opportunities.
- Feel free to modify the existing architecture or add new layers as needed.

Your solution should be optimized for both memory usage and computation speed. Remember that CUDA allows for parallel execution, so try to leverage that as much as possible.
