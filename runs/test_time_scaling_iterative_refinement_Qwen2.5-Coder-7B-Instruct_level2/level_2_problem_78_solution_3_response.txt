Please provide the corrected and debugged version of your code. Ensure it runs without errors and produces the same results as the original architecture when run on the same inputs. 

The error message you received during evaluation was:
```
AttributeError: module '__main__' has no attribute 'Model'
```

This indicates that there might be an issue with how the `Model` class is being imported or referenced in your script. Make sure all necessary classes and functions are properly defined and accessible within the scope where they are used. If you're using relative imports, ensure the directory structure is correctly set up to support them.

Additionally, check for any typos or incorrect variable names that could lead to such errors. Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the script is being executed in the expected environment.

Once you've addressed these issues, re-run the evaluation to see if the problem persists. If the error still occurs, please provide the updated code and any additional details about the environment in which you're running the script.

It seems like there might be an issue with the way the CUDA function is being called or referenced. Double-check the definition and usage of the CUDA function in your script. Ensure that the function is correctly defined and that it is being called with the appropriate arguments. Also, verify that the function is being imported or loaded correctly before it is called.

If the issue persists, please provide the relevant code snippets so I can assist you further.
