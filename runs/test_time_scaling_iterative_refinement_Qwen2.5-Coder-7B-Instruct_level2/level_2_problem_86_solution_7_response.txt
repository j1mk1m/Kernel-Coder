Please ensure that the new implementation is free from errors and works correctly with the provided inputs. If there are any issues, debug them and provide the corrected version. If possible, improve the performance further without compromising correctness.

**Note:** The goal is to optimize the given architecture using custom CUDA operators, so avoid replacing operations that do not offer significant speedup or introducing unnecessary complexity.

Let's see what you come up with!
