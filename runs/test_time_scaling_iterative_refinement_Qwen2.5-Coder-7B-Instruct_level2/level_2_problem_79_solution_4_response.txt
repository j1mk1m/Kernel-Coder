Please ensure that the code runs correctly and produces the same results as the original architecture when tested on a GPU. Your solution should be efficient and take advantage of parallelism where possible. Consider operator fusion, algorithmic optimizations, and other techniques to improve performance. Make sure to include any necessary imports and setup for the CUDA environment.
