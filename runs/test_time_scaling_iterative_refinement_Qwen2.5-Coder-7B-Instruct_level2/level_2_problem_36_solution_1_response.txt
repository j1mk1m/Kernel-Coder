Your latest generated kernel:
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your custom CUDA kernels here...

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, output_padding, bias_shape):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize your custom CUDA operators here...
        pass

    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement your forward method using custom CUDA operators here...
        pass
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'
