The code should be self-contained and include all necessary imports, definitions, and function calls. Make sure the `get_inputs` and `get_init_inputs` functions remain unchanged from the original architecture.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your custom CUDA kernels here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    # Your implementation here

# Don't change these functions
def get_inputs():
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, in_channels, depth, height, width)]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding]
```

Please provide the optimized `ModelNew` class that utilizes custom CUDA operators for the specified operations within the `forward` method.
