### Requirements:

- Replace `nn.Linear` with a custom CUDA kernel for matrix multiplication.
- Implement max pooling using a custom CUDA kernel.
- Implement sum reduction using a custom CUDA kernel.
- Replace the scalar multiplication with a custom CUDA kernel.

Ensure that all operations are performed efficiently and that the resulting `ModelNew` class can be used interchangeably with the original `Model`.
