Please debug and improve your implementation. Ensure that the generated architecture ModelNew and kernel were evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
RuntimeError: CUDA error: invalid device function
```

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
