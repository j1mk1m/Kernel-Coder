Please note that the evaluation will be performed automatically and it will check the correctness of your implementation against the reference architecture Model. If there are any discrepancies, the evaluation will fail and you will need to debug your code accordingly. If your code passes all the checks, you will receive a success message indicating that your implementation is correct and efficient.

Please make sure that your code is well-documented and follows best practices for CUDA programming. This includes proper memory management, error checking, and use of efficient algorithms and data structures. Also, please ensure that your code is portable and can run on different GPUs with varying architectures.

Good luck!
