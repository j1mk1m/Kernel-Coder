    You should aim to maximize the performance of the Model class by replacing the most computationally expensive operations with custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of operations and optimizations.

Here is a hint to get started: Consider replacing the `nn.ConvTranspose3d` operation with a custom CUDA kernel that implements the transpose convolution operation more efficiently than PyTorch's default implementation. This can significantly improve the performance of the model, especially when dealing with large input sizes. Additionally, consider optimizing the Softmax and Sigmoid operations using custom CUDA kernels. These operations are computationally expensive and can benefit from optimization to achieve better performance.
