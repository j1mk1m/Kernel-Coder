Please ensure your solution is efficient and works correctly. If there are any errors or issues, please debug them and provide the corrected code.

Let's try again. 

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code. 

Make sure to address any issues from the previous attempt and optimize further. Your final solution should be efficient and correct. Let's proceed with the optimization.
