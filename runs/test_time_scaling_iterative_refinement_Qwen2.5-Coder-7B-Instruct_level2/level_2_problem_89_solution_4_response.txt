Please note that your solution should aim to optimize the most computationally intensive parts of the model. For instance, if there are multiple convolutional layers, it might be beneficial to fuse them together. If there are matrix multiplications followed by ReLU activations, consider implementing these as a single fused operation. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining the functionality of the original model. 

Remember to handle edge cases such as different tensor sizes and batch dimensions appropriately. Ensure that the optimized version behaves exactly as the original version for all valid inputs.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
