Please ensure your solution addresses the following points:

- **Correctness**: Ensure the output of `ModelNew` matches the output of `Model`.
- **Efficiency**: Optimize the kernel for better performance on GPU.
- **Operator Fusion**: Consider fusing multiple operations into a single kernel where possible.
- **Algorithmic Changes**: Explore alternative algorithms that could be more efficient on GPU.

Here is your latest generated kernel:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Improve upon your previous attempts by debugging any correctness issues or improving the efficiency if the kernel was correct.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
