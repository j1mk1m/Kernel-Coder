Your solution should include the CUDA kernel definitions and any necessary modifications to the `Model` class to use these kernels. If you choose to fuse multiple operations, please provide the fused operation in the CUDA kernel definition. Be as efficient as possible while maintaining readability. Feel free to experiment with different optimizations. For instance, you could optimize the residual addition using an inplace operation or implement a more efficient matrix multiplication algorithm. 

Please provide the final implementation of `ModelNew` including the CUDA kernel definitions and the modified `forward` method. Ensure that the implementation maintains the functionality of the original `Model`. ```python
