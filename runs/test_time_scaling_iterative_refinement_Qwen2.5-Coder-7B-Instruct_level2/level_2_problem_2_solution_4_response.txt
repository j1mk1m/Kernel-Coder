Your latest generated kernel:
```
error: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```


Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Improve upon your previous attempts by debugging any correctness issues or improving the efficiency if the kernel was correct.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code. 


Please note that the kernel should be efficient and handle large inputs without running into memory errors or excessive computation time. Consider using shared memory if applicable and optimizing the kernel layout for better performance. Also, ensure that the kernel correctly implements the operations specified in the original architecture, including the transposed convolution, bias addition, clamping, scaling, and division.

Please provide the updated code for the optimized architecture ModelNew and the corresponding CUDA kernel.
