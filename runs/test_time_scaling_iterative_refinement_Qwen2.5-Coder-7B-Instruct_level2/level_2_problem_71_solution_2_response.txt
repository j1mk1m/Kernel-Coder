Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Improve upon your previous attempts by debugging any correctness issues or improving the efficiency if the kernel was correct.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code. 

Make sure the kernel has no errors and it is correctly implemented. Ensure that the `forward` method of `ModelNew` calls the CUDA kernel properly and that the results match those of the original `Model`. If there are any discrepancies, debug them until they are resolved.

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Improve upon your previous attempts by debugging any correctness issues or improving the efficiency if the kernel was correct.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code. 

Make sure the kernel has no errors and it is correctly implemented. Ensure that the `forward` method of `ModelNew` calls the CUDA kernel properly and that the results match those of the original `Model`. If there are any discrepancies, debug them until they are resolved.

Your latest generated kernel:
```
error: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel were evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```
