Please note that it's acceptable to use other libraries such as PyTorch C++ extensions, but please provide a clear explanation in the comments if you do so.

### Note:
- **Custom CUDA Kernels:** Implement any operations using custom CUDA kernels that can significantly improve performance. This could include fused operations, algorithmic optimizations, or any other technique that leverages parallel computing capabilities of GPUs.
- **Mish Activation:** Implement the Mish activation function in CUDA. Mish is defined as \( \text{Mish}(x) = x \cdot \tanh(\ln(1 + e^x)) \).
- **Matrix Multiplication:** Consider optimizing the matrix multiplication operation. This could involve implementing a more efficient algorithm or leveraging specific GPU features like tensor cores.

### Constraints:
- Your implementation should be fully functional and compile without errors.
- Ensure that the optimized model produces the same output as the original model when run on the same inputs.
