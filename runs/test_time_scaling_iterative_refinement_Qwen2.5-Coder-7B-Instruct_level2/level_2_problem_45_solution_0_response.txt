Make sure the ModelNew class can be instantiated and used just like the original Model class.

Please include any additional helper functions or classes needed to support the custom CUDA kernels in the ModelNew class.

```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    """
    Optimized version of the Model using custom CUDA operators.
    """
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize layers here
        pass

    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement the forward pass using custom CUDA operators
        pass

# Example usage:
model_new = ModelNew(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
inputs = get_inputs()
outputs = model_new(inputs[0])
print(outputs.shape)
```

```python
def get_inputs():
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, input_size)]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [input_size, hidden_size, output_size]
```

Your implementation should focus on optimizing the matrix multiplications (`nn.Linear`), sigmoid activation, and logsumexp operation. Feel free to explore other potential optimizations such as fusing operations or using more efficient algorithms. Ensure that the overall functionality remains the same as the original Model class.
