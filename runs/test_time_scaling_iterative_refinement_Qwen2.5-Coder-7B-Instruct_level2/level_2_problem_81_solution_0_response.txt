### Constraints:
- You must use `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` to define and compile your custom CUDA kernels.
- You can only modify the `Model` class to create `ModelNew`.
- You cannot change the `get_inputs` or `get_init_inputs` functions.

### Tips:
- Consider fusing multiple operations together to reduce the number of CUDA calls.
- Use efficient algorithms for operations like clamping and tanh.
- Be mindful of memory access patterns and ensure they are coalesced for better performance.
