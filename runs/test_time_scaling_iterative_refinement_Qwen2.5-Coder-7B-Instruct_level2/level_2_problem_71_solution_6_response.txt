Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Improve upon your previous attempts by debugging any correctness issues or improving the efficiency if the kernel was correct.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code. 

Please ensure that your final solution is efficient and correct. If you encounter any issues, debug them and provide the corrected code. Make sure that your solution works correctly on both CPU and GPU. If necessary, adjust your implementation to handle both cases.

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Improve upon your previous attempts by debugging any correctness issues or improving the efficiency if the kernel was correct.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code. 

Please ensure that your final solution is efficient and correct. If you encounter any issues, debug them and provide the corrected code. Make sure that your solution works correctly on both CPU and GPU. If necessary, adjust your implementation to handle both cases.

Your latest generated kernel:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel were evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```
