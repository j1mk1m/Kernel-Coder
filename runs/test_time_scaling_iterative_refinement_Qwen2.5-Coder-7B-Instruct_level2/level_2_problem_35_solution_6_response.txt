Please ensure that the new kernel is correctly implemented and the architecture is free of errors. If there are any issues, debug them and provide the corrected code.

Your latest generated kernel:
```
/data/user_data/gyeongwk/Kernel-Coder/cache/test_time_scaling_iterative_refinement_Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct_level2/level_2_problem_35_solution_4/convolution/convolution.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel were evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid decimal literal (<string>, line 3)
```


Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Improve upon your previous attempts by debugging any correctness issues or improving the efficiency if the kernel was correct.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
