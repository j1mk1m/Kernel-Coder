Your latest generated kernel:
```
error: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```


Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! 
Ensure that the kernel correctly implements the operation it is intended to perform, and that the overall architecture remains functional when using the new kernels.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
