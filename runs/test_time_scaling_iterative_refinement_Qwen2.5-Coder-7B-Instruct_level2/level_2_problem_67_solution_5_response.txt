Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Make sure that all operations are correctly implemented and the architecture runs without errors. If there are any issues, debug them and provide the corrected code.
Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
