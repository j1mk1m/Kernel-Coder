Please ensure that the custom CUDA kernel is correctly implemented and integrated into the `ModelNew` class. Additionally, verify that the output from `ModelNew` matches the output from the original `Model`. If there are discrepancies, debug the issue and provide the corrected version of the code. 

Your latest generated kernel:
```
error: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel were evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
