Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel was evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators!
Make sure that the code compiles and runs correctly on a GPU. Also, ensure that the output of ModelNew matches the output of the original Model. If there are discrepancies, debug and fix them.

Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code.
