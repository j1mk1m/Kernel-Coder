Please ensure that the new architecture ModelNew correctly implements the same functionality as the original Model while potentially being faster due to the use of custom CUDA operators. If there are any correctness issues, please fix them before submitting your final solution.

Please note that you should aim to optimize the most computationally intensive parts of the model, such as the convolutional layers, normalization layers, and activations. By doing so, you can significantly improve the overall performance of the model.
