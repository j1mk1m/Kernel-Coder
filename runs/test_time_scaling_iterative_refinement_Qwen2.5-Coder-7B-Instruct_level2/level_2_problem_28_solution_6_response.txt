Please note that I am looking for an efficient implementation using CUDA that can significantly improve the performance of the given architecture. Your solution should take advantage of parallelism and avoid unnecessary memory transfers. If there are any potential bottlenecks, please address them in your implementation.

Your latest generated kernel:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
```

Your generated architecture ModelNew and kernel were evaluated on GPU and checked against the reference architecture Model.

Here is your Evaluation Result:
```
invalid syntax (<string>, line 3)
