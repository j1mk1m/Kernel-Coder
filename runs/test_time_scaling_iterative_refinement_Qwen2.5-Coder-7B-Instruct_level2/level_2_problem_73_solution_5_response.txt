Please include any debug information or comments explaining your approach in the code blocks. Your final solution should be efficient and correct. 


### Debugging Information:

- **Kernel Syntax**: Ensure the CUDA kernel syntax is correct. Pay attention to semicolons, curly braces, and parentheses.
- **Memory Access Patterns**: Optimize memory access patterns to improve cache hit rates and reduce global memory bandwidth usage.
- **Block and Grid Dimensions**: Choose appropriate block and grid dimensions to balance parallelism and avoid excessive thread divergence.
- **Error Handling**: Add error handling to ensure the kernel executes correctly and handle potential runtime errors.
- **Algorithmic Improvements**: Consider algorithmic improvements such as fused operations or alternative algorithms to reduce computational complexity.

### Example Debugging Steps:

1. **Check CUDA Kernel Syntax**: Ensure all CUDA kernel syntax elements are correctly placed.
2. **Verify Memory Access Patterns**: Review how data is accessed within the kernel to ensure it follows efficient patterns.
3. **Adjust Block and Grid Dimensions**: Experiment with different block and grid dimensions to find the optimal configuration.
4. **Add Error Handling**: Implement error checking to ensure the kernel executes without errors.
5. **Profile and Benchmark**: Use profiling tools to benchmark the performance of the kernel and identify bottlenecks.

By addressing these points, you can optimize the architecture and ensure it meets the desired performance criteria.
