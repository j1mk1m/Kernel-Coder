Name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks in markdown format (i.e. ```python or ```cpp). Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not output testing code. 

Please ensure that the code is free from errors and follows best practices for CUDA programming. Also, optimize the performance of the GEMM operation using efficient algorithms such as CUBLAS or cuBLASLt. For the BatchNorm operation, implement a more efficient algorithm such as online batch normalization. Finally, fuse the GELU and ReLU operations together into a single kernel for improved performance.
