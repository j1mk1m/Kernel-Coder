Please note that you can use any CUDA programming techniques you deem necessary to optimize the performance of the model. This includes but is not limited to:

- Using shared memory for intermediate results
- Implementing efficient memory access patterns
- Combining multiple operations into a single kernel
- Using warp-level parallelism to maximize throughput
- Utilizing CUDA streams for overlapping computation and data transfer

Your goal is to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining correctness. 

Remember to provide detailed explanations of your optimization strategies and how they improve performance. Your explanation should be clear and understandable even to someone who is not familiar with CUDA programming.
