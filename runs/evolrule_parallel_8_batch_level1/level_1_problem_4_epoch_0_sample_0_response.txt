The code for the original Model is given above. Replace the forward function of the ModelNew class with your optimized version. You may need to write a custom CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication. 

Note: The shapes of the inputs are large (M=2048, K=1,048,576). For such large matrices, consider how to efficiently implement the matrix-vector multiplication on the GPU. Think about how to parallelize the computation, handle memory access patterns, and possibly exploit shared memory or other optimizations.

Consider that the default torch.matmul might not be optimal for these particular dimensions. Perhaps there's a way to exploit the vector being a column (K,1) to treat it as a vector and compute the result more efficiently. 

When writing the CUDA kernel, think about:

1. How to partition the computation across threads and blocks.
2. How to minimize memory transactions and maximize coalesced access.
3. Whether to use shared memory for caching parts of the matrices.
4. How to handle large matrix dimensions that may exceed the capacity of shared memory or thread block sizes.

Make sure your code is compatible with PyTorch's autograd system. Since you are replacing a matmul operator with a custom CUDA kernel, the kernel needs to be differentiable. However, for the sake of simplicity and the scope of this question, you may assume that the autograd is handled by PyTorch's automatic differentiation, so you don't need to implement backward passes unless necessary. 

You can assume that the inputs are on the GPU already. 

The goal is to write a CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication (A (M x K) * B (K x 1) = C (M x 1)) that is faster than the default PyTorch implementation. 

Also, remember to use the inline loading with load_inline as in the example. 

Finally, make sure that the ModelNew class correctly replaces the forward pass with your custom implementation.

I have a question about the CUDA kernel you wrote. Specifically, in the matvecmul_kernel, the shared memory dimensions for shared_A are set to 32x1024. How did you determine those dimensions? Also, why is the loop over k using blockDim.x multiplied by gridDim.x as the step size?
