) with all dependencies (e.g., CUDA kernels, imports, etc.)
2. A short explanation (1-2 sentences) of why the optimization is valid and the benefits it brings.
3. A time comparison between the original and optimized versions using 3000 runs on the provided get_inputs(). The time comparison should be in the format:
Original: X.XX seconds
Optimized: X.XX seconds
Speedup: X.XXx
Note: The numbers here are placeholders and should be replaced with actual measurements from your code. However, since I can't execute code, provide the expected values based on your optimizations.

The code must not include any testing code. Only the ModelNew class and dependencies. The explanation and time comparison should be in English.
