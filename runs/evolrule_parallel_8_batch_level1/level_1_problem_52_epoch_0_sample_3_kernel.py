# Note: The above code assumes that the input tensors are on the GPU (cuda). The get_inputs function in the original code may need to be adjusted to move tensors to CUDA. The provided code includes .cuda() in get_inputs to ensure that inputs are on the GPU. The kernel itself is designed to work with CUDA tensors. The dim variable from the original code (set to 1) is used in get_init_inputs. The output is cast to long (int64) to match PyTorch's argmin behavior.
