  "The kernel transposes matrix B tiles in shared memory to enable efficient column-major access.",
  "The kernel uses shared memory tiles sized to reduce global memory fetch overhead and mitigate bank conflicts.",
  "The kernel minimizes synchronization by synchronizing only after shared memory tile loads rather than after each computation step."
