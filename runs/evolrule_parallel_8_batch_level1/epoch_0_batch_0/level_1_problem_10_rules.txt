    
Based on the analysis, identify the rule-like statements that differentiate the kernels:
1. The kernel performs operator fusion between multiple operations.
2. The kernel uses shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access.
3. The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).
4. The kernel handles tensor dimensions dynamically without hardcoding constants.
5. The kernel uses synchronization points (e.g., `__syncthreads()`) correctly within memory access loops.
6. The kernel launches with grid/block dimensions aligned to tile sizes for memory coalescing.
The fastest kernel (first solution) uses shared memory tiling and block dimensions matching warp multiples. The third solution is incorrect because it hardcodes constants. The second solution lacks shared memory tiling. The eighth solution uses smaller tile sizes.
JSON Array: ["The kernel uses shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access.", "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).", "The kernel handles tensor dimensions dynamically without hardcoding constants."]
These statements capture the three key differentiators from the analysis: shared memory tiling, warp-aligned blocks, and avoiding hardcoded dimensions.
