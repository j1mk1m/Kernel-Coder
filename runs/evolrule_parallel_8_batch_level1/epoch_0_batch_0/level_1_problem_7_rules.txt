    "The kernel uses shared memory tiles with dimensions that are powers of two to align with warp size and reduce bank conflicts.",
    "The kernel loads data into shared memory in a tiled manner to reduce global memory access latency.",
    "The kernel uses proper synchronization (__syncthreads()) between shared memory loads and computation."
