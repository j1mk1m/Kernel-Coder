# The above code defines a custom CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication. The kernel uses a 2D thread block layout to parallelize over the output matrix's rows and columns. Each thread computes one element of the resulting matrix by iterating over the common dimension (K). The kernel launch configuration is tuned to handle large matrices efficiently. The custom implementation replaces the default torch.matmul to potentially reduce overhead and improve memory access patterns for this specific problem size.
