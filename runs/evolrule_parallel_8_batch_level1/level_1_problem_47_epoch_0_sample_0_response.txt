The code should work on pytorch 2.2.0 and CUDA 12.1. Make sure you use the correct CUDA syntax and PyTorch extension APIs. Use torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline. The code must be compatible with the existing test harness. 

To implement the sum operation, you can use a CUDA kernel that efficiently reduces along the specified dimension. Since the reduction is along a single dimension, you can design a kernel that handles this efficiently using CUDA threads and blocks. You may also want to use shared memory for better performance. The input tensor has a shape of (batch_size, dim1, dim2), and the reduction is along the dim1 dimension (since the code above specifies reduce_dim =1). 

Make sure that your code has the same interface as the original Model class. The new ModelNew class must have the same __init__ and forward method signatures. The get_inputs and get_init_inputs functions are already provided and must remain unchanged. 

Ensure that the reduction is performed along the correct dimension, and that keepdim=True is maintained so the output has the same number of dimensions as the input. 

The original code uses torch.sum, which is a highly optimized operator, so your kernel needs to be at least as efficient or more so. Consider using CUDA's warp-level primitives or other optimization techniques. 

The final code should have the same inputs and outputs as the original. The test harness will check for correctness and speed. 

Start your answer with the optimized code for the architecture. The user will then ask for a detailed explanation of your optimization strategy. So the first step is to write the code that is correct and optimized.

### Explanation of the Optimization Strategy

The original `torch.sum` operator is highly optimized, but by implementing a custom CUDA kernel, we can potentially exploit specific characteristics of the input tensor's shape and the reduction dimension to achieve better performance. Here's a breakdown of the optimization approach:

1. **Kernel Design for Reduction:**
   - The kernel is designed to handle the reduction along a specified dimension efficiently. The input tensor is assumed to be contiguous (using `.contiguous()`) to ensure coalesced memory access.
   - The reduction is performed in parallel across threads, using shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory bandwidth usage.

2. **Shape Handling:**
   - The kernel computes the outer and inner dimensions relative to the reduction dimension. For a tensor with shape `(batch_size, dim1, dim2)` and reduction along `dim=1`, the outer dimension is `batch_size`, the reduction dimension is `dim1`, and the inner dimension is `dim2`.
   - The grid and block dimensions are calculated based on these computed dimensions to launch the appropriate number of blocks and threads.

3. **Shared Memory and Block Reduction:**
   - Each thread computes a partial sum over a segment of the reduction dimension.
   - Shared memory is used to store intermediate sums, allowing efficient block-wide reduction. This reduces the number of global memory accesses and leverages on-chip memory for faster computations.
   - The reduction is performed in two stages: a block-wide reduction using shared memory and a warp-level reduction for the final 32 threads, utilizing CUDA's warp-level primitives for efficiency.

4. **Warp-Level Primitives:**
   - The final reduction step within a warp (32 threads) uses warp-synchronous programming to minimize divergence and maximize parallel efficiency. This avoids the need for multiple kernel launches and synchronization points.

5. **Compatibility and Correctness:**
   - The kernel ensures that the output tensor retains the same dimensions as the input except for the reduced dimension, which is set to 1 (as per `keepdim=True`).
   - The kernel uses `AT_DISPATCH_FLOATING_TYPES` to handle different floating-point types, maintaining compatibility with PyTorch's data types.

6. **Performance Considerations:**
   - The block size is set to 256, a common choice for CUDA kernels to balance occupancy and memory access patterns.
   - The kernel is designed to handle tensors with arbitrary dimensions beyond the example provided, making it adaptable to different input shapes while focusing on the specific reduction dimension.

This approach aims to match or exceed the performance of the PyTorch implementation by optimizing memory access patterns, leveraging shared memory, and using efficient reduction techniques tailored to the specific reduction operation.
