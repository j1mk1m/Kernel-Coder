Your solution should include any necessary imports, the definition of the `ModelNew` class, and any other code required to make the custom CUDA operators work. Your code should be as efficient as possible while maintaining correctness. 

Note: You can use PyTorch's C++ extension utilities to create custom CUDA operators, but ensure that your code adheres to PyTorch's conventions and best practices.
