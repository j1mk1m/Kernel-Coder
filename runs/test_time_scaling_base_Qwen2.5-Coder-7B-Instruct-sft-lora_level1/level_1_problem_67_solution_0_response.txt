Please provide your reasoning for each choice of operators to replace with custom CUDA kernels, including any performance improvements expected. 

**Note**: You are encouraged to use techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, and parallelism to optimize the performance of the model. However, you should avoid replacing too many operators since it may lead to increased complexity and potential errors. Only replace those operators that can significantly improve performance.

### Reasoning:

Replace the `nn.Conv1d` operator with a custom CUDA kernel because it performs matrix multiplication under the hood, which is highly amenable to parallelization. By implementing the convolution using custom CUDA code, we can take advantage of GPU parallelism to accelerate the computation. This is expected to result in significant speedup compared to the PyTorch default implementation, especially for large input sizes and batch sizes.
