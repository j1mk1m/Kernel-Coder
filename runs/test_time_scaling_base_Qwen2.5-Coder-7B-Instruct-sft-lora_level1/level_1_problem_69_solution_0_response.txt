### Constraints:
- Your implementation should be compatible with PyTorch's CUDA capabilities.
- You should aim for performance improvements over the original PyTorch implementation.
- You can use any standard libraries available in PyTorch or CUDA, but avoid using external libraries unless necessary.
- Ensure that your custom CUDA kernels handle edge cases appropriately, such as batch sizes, channel counts, and kernel sizes.
