The goal is to replace the PyTorch operator `nn.AvgPool2d` with a custom CUDA kernel for faster execution. You can use any method you see fit to achieve this, such as operator fusion, algorithmic optimizations, etc.

Please provide the full code including the definition of the custom CUDA kernel and the new architecture class `ModelNew`.
