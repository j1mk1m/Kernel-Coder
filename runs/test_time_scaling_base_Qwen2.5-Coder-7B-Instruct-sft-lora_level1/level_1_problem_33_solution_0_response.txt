Your implementation should aim to achieve faster inference times compared to the original PyTorch implementation. Feel free to choose any subset of the operations to optimize, but ensure that the functionality remains the same. Your solution can involve operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or other optimization techniques. Justify your choices. 

For reference, here is how you would call the `get_inputs` function:

```python
inputs = get_inputs()
model_new = ModelNew(get_init_inputs()[0])
output = model_new(inputs[0])
```

**Note:** This question assumes familiarity with PyTorch and CUDA programming. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask.
