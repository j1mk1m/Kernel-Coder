Please follow the same structure as the example provided above, i.e., define the custom CUDA kernel within the `ModelNew` class, compile it using `load_inline`, and then use the compiled kernel in the `forward` method of `ModelNew`. Make sure to include any necessary imports at the beginning of your code.
