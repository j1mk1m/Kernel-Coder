Here's what I'm looking for:

- Custom CUDA kernel implementation(s) replacing the PyTorch operators.
- A new class `ModelNew` that inherits from `nn.Module`.
- The new class should use the custom CUDA kernels instead of the PyTorch operators.
- The forward method should be implemented using these custom CUDA kernels.
- Ensure the new architecture maintains the same functionality as the original architecture.
- Make sure the code is fully functional and can be run without errors.
