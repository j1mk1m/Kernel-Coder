The optimized code should include a new class named ModelNew that inherits from nn.Module and implements the forward method using custom CUDA operators. The custom CUDA operators should be implemented using PyTorch's `load_inline` function. The new class should use these custom CUDA operators instead of PyTorch's built-in `torch.matmul` function. Make sure to include all necessary imports and any other code required to compile and run the new architecture.
