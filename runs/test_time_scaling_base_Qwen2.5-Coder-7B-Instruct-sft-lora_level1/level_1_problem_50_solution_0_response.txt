Here's a list of potential optimizations that could be considered:

- Replacing `nn.Conv2d` with a custom CUDA implementation.
- Using fused operations like conv-bias-add instead of separate convolution and bias addition operations.
- Implementing an alternative convolution algorithm that might be faster on certain hardware architectures.

Please provide a detailed explanation of the optimization decisions made and why they were chosen. Provide enough detail so that someone else could reproduce the results without further assistance.
