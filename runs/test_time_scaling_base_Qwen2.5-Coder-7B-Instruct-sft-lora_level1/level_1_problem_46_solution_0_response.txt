Here are some guidelines:
- Your custom CUDA operators should be efficient and utilize parallelism available on the GPU.
- Choose the appropriate CUDA data types for better performance.
- Optimize memory access patterns to reduce cache misses.
- Consider operator fusion opportunities to combine multiple operations into a single kernel.
- Document any changes you made to the original architecture for clarity.
- Ensure that the optimized architecture maintains the same functionality as the original one.
