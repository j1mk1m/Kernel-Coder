### Constraints:
- Your implementation must be written in C++ and CUDA.
- You cannot use any PyTorch built-in operations except for those that are necessary for the initialization of the model parameters (e.g., `torch.zeros`, `torch.randn`).
- You should aim to optimize the performance of the `forward` method of the `Model` class.
- You can add any additional helper functions or classes as needed.
- You must include all necessary imports at the beginning of your code.
- Ensure that the code is well-documented and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
