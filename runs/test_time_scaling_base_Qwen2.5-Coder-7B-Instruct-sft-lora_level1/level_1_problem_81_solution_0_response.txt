Please provide the optimized code for ModelNew that uses custom CUDA kernels to optimize the performance of the 2D transposed convolution operation. Ensure that the custom CUDA kernels are implemented efficiently and correctly handle the specified parameters such as in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, and dilation.
