Please note that the input tensor has dimensions (batch_size, in_channels, depth, height, width) and the output tensor should also have the same dimensions. The transposed 3D convolution operation should be replaced with a custom CUDA kernel. Make sure that the kernel handles all edge cases correctly, such as different batch sizes, channel counts, depths, heights, and widths. The kernel should also handle different strides, paddings, and output paddings.
