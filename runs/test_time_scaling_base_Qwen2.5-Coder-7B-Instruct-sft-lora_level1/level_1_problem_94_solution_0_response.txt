Please note that the goal is to maximize performance improvements through the use of custom CUDA kernels. Therefore, focus on replacing operators that would benefit most from GPU acceleration. In this case, the MSE computation can be optimized since it involves matrix operations that can be parallelized efficiently on GPUs.
