Please provide the optimized code for `ModelNew` using custom CUDA kernels for the Softsign operation. 

The goal is to significantly improve the performance of the Softsign operation, which can be computationally intensive due to the use of absolute values and division. By implementing this operation in CUDA, we can leverage parallel computing capabilities to accelerate the computation.
