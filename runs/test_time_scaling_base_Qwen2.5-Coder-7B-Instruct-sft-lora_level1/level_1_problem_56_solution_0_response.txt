Note that you should provide both the Python and CUDA source code for the custom operators. Ensure that the custom operators are properly integrated into the PyTorch model. 

Also, please include comments explaining any significant changes or optimizations made. 

Remember that you are free to choose which operations to optimize and how to structure the custom CUDA kernels. The goal is to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining functionality.
