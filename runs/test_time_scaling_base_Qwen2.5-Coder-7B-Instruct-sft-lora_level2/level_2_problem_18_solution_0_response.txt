Please note that you can replace any number of operators within the architecture, but you must provide a full implementation of the new architecture including the `ModelNew` class definition. Your solution should aim to optimize performance, potentially through algorithmic improvements or the use of efficient CUDA kernels.

### Hints:

- Consider replacing the matrix multiplication (`torch.matmul`) with a more efficient implementation if applicable.
- Explore opportunities for fusing multiple operations together into a single CUDA kernel.
- Look into alternative algorithms for operations like `logsumexp`, which might be faster on GPU.
- If you decide to replace an operation with a CUDA kernel, ensure that the kernel handles edge cases correctly and efficiently.
