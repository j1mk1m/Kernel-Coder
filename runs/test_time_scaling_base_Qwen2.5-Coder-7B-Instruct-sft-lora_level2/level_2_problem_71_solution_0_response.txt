Here are the steps you should follow:

1. Identify the operations that can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels.
2. Write the CUDA kernels for these operations.
3. Compile the CUDA kernels using `load_inline` from PyTorch.
4. Replace the original operations with the custom CUDA kernels in the `ModelNew` class.

Make sure to include any necessary imports at the beginning of the code blocks.

**Note:** The goal is to achieve faster computation times by leveraging the power of CUDA GPUs. Feel free to experiment with different operations and algorithms to find the best approach for optimizing the given model.
