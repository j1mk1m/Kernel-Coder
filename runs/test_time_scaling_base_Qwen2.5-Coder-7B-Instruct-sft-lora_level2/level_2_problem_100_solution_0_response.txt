### Requirements:

- Replace `nn.ConvTranspose3d` with a custom CUDA kernel for transposed 3D convolution.
- Optionally, replace other operations such as `clamp` and division with custom CUDA kernels if deemed beneficial for performance.

Here is the starting point for the new architecture:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the custom CUDA kernel for transposed 3D convolution
transposed_3d_conv_source = """
// Your CUDA kernel code here
"""

transposed_3d_conv_cpp_source = (
    "torch::Tensor transposed_3d_conv_cuda(torch::Tensor input, torch::Tensor weight, torch::IntArrayRef stride, torch::IntArrayRef padding);"
)

# Compile the inline CUDA code for transposed 3D convolution
transposed_3d_conv = load_inline(
    name="transposed_3d_conv",
    cpp_sources=transposed_3d_conv_cpp_source,
    cuda_sources=transposed_3d_conv_source,
    functions=["transposed_3d_conv_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, min_value, divisor):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.transposed_3d_conv = transposed_3d_conv
        self.min_value = min_value
        self.divisor = divisor

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.transposed_3d_conv.transposed_3d_conv_cuda(x, self.weight, self.stride, self.padding)
        x = torch.clamp(x, min=self.min_value)
        x = x / self.divisor
        return x
```

Fill in the missing parts of the code to complete the optimization. Ensure that the architecture is fully functional and efficient.
