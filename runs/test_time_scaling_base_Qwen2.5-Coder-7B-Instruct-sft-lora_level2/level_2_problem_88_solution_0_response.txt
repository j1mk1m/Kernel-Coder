Please include the necessary imports at the beginning of the code. 

Your implementation should focus on optimizing performance by leveraging CUDA capabilities. Feel free to experiment with different operators and algorithms to achieve the best performance.

Note: You can use the `load_inline` function from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile and load custom CUDA kernels directly within your Python script. Ensure that your CUDA kernels are well-optimized for the target hardware.
