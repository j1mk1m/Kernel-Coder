Your answer should include:

- A description of any optimizations you made to the original architecture.
- Any new custom CUDA operators you created.
- The updated `ModelNew` class definition.

Please note that the goal is to maximize performance while maintaining correctness. Feel free to experiment with different optimization techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or even changing the data layout if it can lead to better performance. Your solution should provide a significant speedup compared to the original implementation.
