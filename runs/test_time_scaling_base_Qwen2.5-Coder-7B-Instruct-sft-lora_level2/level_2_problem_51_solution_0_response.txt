Please note that you can only use custom CUDA operators to optimize the given architecture. You cannot add any other Python code or libraries. Your goal is to achieve maximum performance improvement by leveraging the power of CUDA.

Here is the reference implementation of the Model class:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Model that performs a series of operations: Gemm, Subtract, GlobalAvgPool, LogSumExp, GELU, and ResidualAdd.
    """
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, bias=True):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.gemm = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features, bias=bias)
        self.subtract = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_features))

    def forward(self, x):
        original_x = x.clone().detach()
        # Gemm
        x = self.gemm(x)

        # Subtract
        x = x - self.subtract

        # GlobalAvgPool
        x = torch.mean(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)

        # LogSumExp
        x = torch.logsumexp(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)

        # GELU
        x = torch.nn.functional.gelu(x)

        # ResidualAdd
        x = x + original_x

        return x

batch_size = 2048
in_features = 8192
out_features = 8192

def get_inputs():
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, in_features)]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [in_features, out_features]
```

Your task is to optimize the `Model` class using custom CUDA operators to achieve better performance. Provide the optimized `ModelNew` class in codeblock format. Make sure the code is fully functional and does not require additional dependencies beyond what is provided in the reference implementation.
