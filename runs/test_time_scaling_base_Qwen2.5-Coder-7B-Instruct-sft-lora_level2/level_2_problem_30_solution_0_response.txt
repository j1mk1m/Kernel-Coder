Please note that the original implementation uses PyTorch's built-in operators which can be replaced with more efficient custom CUDA operators. Your goal is to optimize the performance of the model by replacing these operators with custom CUDA kernels.

Also, you should provide the `get_inputs` function for the new architecture. This function should generate inputs based on the new architecture's requirements. Note that the `get_init_inputs` function remains unchanged. 

The `ModelNew` class should inherit from `nn.Module` and implement the forward pass using custom CUDA operators where possible. If certain operations cannot be efficiently implemented in CUDA, they can remain as PyTorch's built-in operators. However, aim to maximize the use of custom CUDA kernels for performance improvement.

Finally, ensure that the `forward` method of `ModelNew` returns the same output as the original `Model` class when called with the same inputs. ```
