Note: The model architecture provided is simple but it contains multiple operations that can be optimized using custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to optimize any part of the model that you think will provide the most benefit. Consider operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or any other optimization technique that you find suitable. 

Hint: The Mish activation function can be implemented more efficiently using a custom CUDA kernel than calling the PyTorch implementation directly. Additionally, the matrix multiplication operation can also be optimized by implementing a custom CUDA kernel.

Please note that the final code should be efficient, well-structured, and easy to understand. It should also be fully compatible with PyTorch and utilize the power of GPU acceleration whenever possible.
