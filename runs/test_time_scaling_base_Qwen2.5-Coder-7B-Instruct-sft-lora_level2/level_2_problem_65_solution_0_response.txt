Your implementation should aim to maximize speedup compared to the original PyTorch model. Consider replacing the convolution, average pooling, sigmoid, and sum operations with custom CUDA kernels. You may also consider algorithmic optimizations such as fused operations or alternative implementations of these operators that can be executed more efficiently on GPUs.

Please ensure that your solution adheres to the guidelines provided and does not exceed the scope of the problem statement. Your code should demonstrate a clear understanding of how to implement custom CUDA kernels for deep learning operations and achieve performance improvements through efficient GPU utilization.
