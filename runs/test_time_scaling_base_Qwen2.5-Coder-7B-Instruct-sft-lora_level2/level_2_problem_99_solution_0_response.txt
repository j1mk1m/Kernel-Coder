Your code should be efficient, and ideally leverage operator fusion or algorithmic improvements over the original implementation. Feel free to use any PyTorch functionality as needed.

**NOTE:** Ensure that your solution does not introduce any errors compared to the original implementation and that it maintains the same computational graph structure where possible.
