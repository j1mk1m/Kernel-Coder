Please follow the syntax provided in the example to define and compile the custom CUDA kernels. Your custom CUDA kernels should be designed to optimize the performance of the Model class. Feel free to use any optimization techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or any other method that can improve the performance of the model. Make sure to document any changes you make to the original architecture and explain why they were made.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the custom CUDA kernel for transposed convolution
transposed_convolution_source = """
// Implement the transposed convolution operation here
"""

transposed_convolution_cpp_source = (
    // Declare the function here
)

# Compile the inline CUDA code for transposed convolution
transposed_convolution = load_inline(
    name="transposed_convolution",
    cpp_sources=transposed_convolution_cpp_source,
    cuda_sources=transposed_convolution_source,
    functions=["transposed_convolution_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)


class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, add_value, multiply_value):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.transposed_convolution = transposed_convolution
        self.add_value = add_value
        self.multiply_value = multiply_value

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.transposed_convolution.transposed_convolution_cuda(x, out_channels, kernel_size, stride)
        x = x + self.add_value
        x = torch.min(x, torch.tensor(0.0, device=x.device))
        x = torch.nn.functional.gelu(x)
        x = x * self.multiply_value
        return x
```

Please provide the full code for `ModelNew` with all necessary custom CUDA kernels defined and compiled. Ensure that the code is fully functional and can be executed without errors. Document any changes made to the original architecture and explain why they were made.
