```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, bias=True):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.conv_transpose = nn.ConvTranspose3d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride=stride, padding=padding, bias=bias)
        self.batch_norm = nn.BatchNorm3d(out_channels)
        self.sub_mean = SubMeanCUDA()  # Custom CUDA operator for subtracting mean along spatial dimensions

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv_transpose(x)
        x = self.batch_norm(x)
        x = self.sub_mean(x)  # Use custom CUDA operator instead of torch.mean
        return x
```

Please ensure that your solution includes all necessary imports and definitions for the custom CUDA operator `SubMeanCUDA`. Also, provide the source code for the custom CUDA operator in C++ and CUDA.
