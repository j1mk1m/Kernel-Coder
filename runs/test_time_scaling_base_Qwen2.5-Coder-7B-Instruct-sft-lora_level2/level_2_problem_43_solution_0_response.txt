Here are the steps to follow:

1. Analyze the operations performed by the Model class.
2. Identify which operations can be accelerated using custom CUDA kernels.
3. Implement these operations as custom CUDA kernels.
4. Replace the corresponding PyTorch operations with the custom CUDA kernels in the ModelNew class.

Ensure that your implementation maintains the functionality of the original Model class while providing potential speedups through the use of custom CUDA kernels.
