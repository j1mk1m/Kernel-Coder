Please include any necessary imports at the top of the codeblock.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline
```

Also, please follow the same pattern as the example provided, where the custom CUDA kernel is defined, compiled, and then used within the `ModelNew` class.
