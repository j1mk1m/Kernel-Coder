Here are the steps to follow:

1. Analyze the existing architecture and identify potential bottlenecks or areas where performance can be improved.
2. Decide which operators to replace with custom CUDA kernels.
3. Implement the custom CUDA kernels.
4. Replace the corresponding PyTorch operators with the custom CUDA kernels in the `ModelNew` class.
5. Ensure that the functionality remains the same as the original `Model`.

### Hints:

- Consider replacing the matrix multiplication (`nn.Linear`) and softmax operations with custom CUDA kernels for potentially significant speedups.
- You can use libraries like `pytorch/cpp_extension` to compile and load custom CUDA code.
- Think about operator fusion opportunities, such as combining matrix multiplication and dropout into a single kernel.
- Algorithmic changes, such as online softmax, might also be considered.

### Note:

The goal is to achieve faster execution times while maintaining the same functionality as the original `Model`. Your implementation should be efficient and well-documented.
