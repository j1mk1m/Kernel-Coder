**Note**: You should use `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` to compile your custom CUDA code.

**Hint**: Consider replacing the convolution operation with a custom CUDA kernel, as it can be computationally intensive. Also, look into potential optimizations for the subtraction operations and the Mish activation function.
