Your solution should aim to maximize performance while maintaining correctness. Feel free to experiment with different optimization techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, etc.

Here's an example of what the final answer might look like:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the custom CUDA kernel for convolution and ReLU
conv_relu_source = """
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void conv_relu_kernel(...) {
    // Custom CUDA implementation for convolution followed by ReLU
}

torch::Tensor conv_relu_cuda(torch::Tensor x, ...) {
    // Launch the custom CUDA kernel
}

...

conv_relu = load_inline(...)

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        super().__init__()
        ...

    def forward(self, x):
        ...
        return ...
```

```cpp
// Any additional C++ code needed for the custom CUDA kernel
```

Remember to include all necessary imports and ensure the code is fully functional. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining correctness. Good luck!
