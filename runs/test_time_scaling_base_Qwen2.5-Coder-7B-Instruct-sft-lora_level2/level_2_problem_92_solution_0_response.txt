Please provide the full code for `ModelNew` class including all necessary imports and any helper functions you create.

Here is a list of PyTorch operations you can potentially optimize with custom CUDA kernels:

- Convolution (`nn.Conv2d`)
- Group Normalization (`nn.GroupNorm`)
- Element-wise operations (`torch.add`, `torch.mul`, etc.)
- Activation functions (`torch.tanh`, `torch.relu`, `torch.hardswish`, etc.)
- Reduction operations (`torch.sum`, `torch.max`, `torch.mean`, `logsumexp`, etc.)

Feel free to combine multiple operations into a single kernel if it makes sense. Consider algorithmic optimizations such as fused batch normalization and residual blocks.
