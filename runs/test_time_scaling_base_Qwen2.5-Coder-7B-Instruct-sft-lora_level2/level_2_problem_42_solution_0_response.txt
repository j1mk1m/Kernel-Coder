Your solution should be optimized in terms of both memory usage and execution time. Feel free to change the structure of the model or add any additional layers if necessary. 

**NOTE**: For the sake of simplicity, assume all inputs to the model are on the GPU. If you need to move data between CPU and GPU, use `.to(device)` method.

### Hints:
- Consider replacing the `nn.ConvTranspose2d` layer with a custom CUDA kernel that implements the transpose convolution operation.
- Replace the global average pooling with a custom CUDA kernel that efficiently computes the mean across the spatial dimensions.
- Replace the log-sum-exp operation with a custom CUDA kernel that combines logarithm and summation operations efficiently.
- Consider using tensor core instructions available on NVIDIA GPUs to further optimize performance.
- You can also implement the sum and multiplication operations using efficient CUDA kernels.
- Remember to handle edge cases such as batch size, channel count, and kernel size appropriately.
- Optimize memory access patterns to minimize cache misses and improve bandwidth utilization.
