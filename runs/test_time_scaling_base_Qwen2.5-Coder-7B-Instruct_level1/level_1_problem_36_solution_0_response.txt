Please do not include any unnecessary comments unless they clarify the code. Feel free to use any libraries or tools you see fit. If you decide to fuse multiple operations, please document why it was done. For example:

> Fused `matmul` and `relu` because they can be combined into a single kernel to reduce memory bandwidth usage and improve cache locality. This results in a significant performance improvement.

Make sure to follow all best practices for writing efficient CUDA code. 

Note: You should also provide a brief explanation of why certain operations were chosen for optimization and how the optimizations impact performance.
