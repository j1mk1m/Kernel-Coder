### Requirements:

- You must use custom CUDA kernels to replace the 2D transposed convolution (`nn.ConvTranspose2d`) operation.
- Your implementation should support all parameters of the original `nn.ConvTranspose2d` (including dilation, padding, and stride).
- Ensure that the functionality of the original model remains intact after optimization.
- The solution should be efficient in terms of computational resources.
- Feel free to experiment with different approaches such as operator fusion, algorithmic optimizations, etc.

### Hints:

- Consider how the 2D transposed convolution can be implemented using matrix operations and how these can be parallelized efficiently on the GPU.
- Think about potential optimizations related to memory access patterns and data locality.
- You may need to implement auxiliary functions or kernels to handle specific aspects of the computation, such as padding or dilation.
