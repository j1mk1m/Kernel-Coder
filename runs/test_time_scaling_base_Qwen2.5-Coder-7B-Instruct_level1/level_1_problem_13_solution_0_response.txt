### Constraints:

- You must use custom CUDA kernels for at least one operation in the `forward` method of `ModelNew`.
- You can optimize any part of the architecture, including but not limited to the matrix multiplication operation.
- Feel free to introduce additional helper functions or classes if necessary.
- Ensure that the resulting `ModelNew` class maintains the same interface as the original `Model` class (`__init__`, `forward`, etc.).

### Note:

The goal is to achieve significant performance improvements through custom CUDA kernels, so focus on optimizing operations where potential bottlenecks exist, such as large-scale linear algebra operations.
