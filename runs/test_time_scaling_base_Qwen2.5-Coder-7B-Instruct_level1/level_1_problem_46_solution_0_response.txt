### Constraints:
- You must use CUDA for all operations within the forward method of ModelNew.
- Your solution should leverage CUDA's parallel processing capabilities to improve performance.
- You are free to change any part of the architecture to achieve better performance, including but not limited to changing the data layout, using different algorithms, or combining multiple operations into a single kernel.
- Ensure that your implementation handles edge cases appropriately, such as when the input dimensions are not multiples of the kernel size.
- The final code should be efficient, easy to understand, and maintainable.
