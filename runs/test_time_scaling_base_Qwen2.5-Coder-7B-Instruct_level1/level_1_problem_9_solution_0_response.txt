The goal is to maximize performance for the given architecture using custom CUDA kernels, while maintaining correctness. Feel free to experiment with different algorithms, data layouts, and optimizations. Your solution should be well-documented and explain your choices. 

Here are some tips to help you optimize the architecture:

- Consider operator fusion opportunities (combining multiple operations into a single kernel).
- Experiment with different matrix layout options (e.g., column-major vs row-major).
- Use efficient memory access patterns (e.g., coalesced memory accesses).
- Optimize for specific hardware architectures (e.g., use warp-level parallelism).

Your final answer should be a working implementation of ModelNew that achieves significantly better performance than the original Model when run on a GPU. Make sure to test your implementation thoroughly and document any trade-offs you made during optimization.
