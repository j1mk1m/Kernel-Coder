The goal is to provide an implementation that runs faster than the original PyTorch version while maintaining the same functionality. Feel free to use any optimization techniques such as algorithmic changes, operator fusion, or custom CUDA kernels. Your solution should be efficient and take full advantage of GPU parallelism.
