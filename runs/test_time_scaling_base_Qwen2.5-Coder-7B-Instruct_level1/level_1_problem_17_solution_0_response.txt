Please note that the model is performing a simple matrix multiplication operation. You can use any CUDA optimization technique you see fit, including but not limited to:

- Using shared memory for faster access to data.
- Implementing tiling to improve cache utilization.
- Optimizing the block and grid dimensions for better parallelism.
- Using fused multiply-add operations if available on your GPU.

Remember to provide all necessary imports and ensure the code is self-contained.
