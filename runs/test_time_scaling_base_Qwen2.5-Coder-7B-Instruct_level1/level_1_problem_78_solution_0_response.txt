Your code should be well commented to explain what each part does, especially any parts that are non-trivial or use advanced techniques. For example, if you decide to fuse two operations together, comment why you chose to do so and how it improves performance. If you implement an alternative algorithm, comment on the trade-offs between your implementation and the original PyTorch implementation.
