Your solution should include a brief description of the optimization techniques used and any performance improvements observed. 

Please note that the provided architecture uses PyTorch's built-in `nn.ConvTranspose3d` layer which can be computationally expensive due to its reliance on cuDNN optimizations. By implementing a custom CUDA kernel, we aim to achieve better performance, especially when dealing with large batch sizes and complex data volumes.
