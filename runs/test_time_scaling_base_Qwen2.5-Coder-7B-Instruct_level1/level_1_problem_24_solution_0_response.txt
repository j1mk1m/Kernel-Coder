Your goal is to maximize performance, so feel free to use any CUDA optimization techniques such as shared memory, coalesced memory access, etc. 

Also, note that there is no need to change the signature of the forward method or the class definition. Only optimize the implementation within the forward method. Feel free to add helper methods or classes if necessary.
