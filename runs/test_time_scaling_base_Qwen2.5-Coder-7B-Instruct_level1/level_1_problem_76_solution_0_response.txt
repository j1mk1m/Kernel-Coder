Make sure to include any necessary imports at the beginning of your code. Your solution should aim to optimize performance, particularly focusing on the convolution operation, which is often a bottleneck in neural networks. Consider using techniques such as shared memory, coalesced memory access patterns, and efficient grid/block configurations to maximize GPU utilization. 

Please provide a brief explanation of your optimization strategy and how it improves performance. ```
