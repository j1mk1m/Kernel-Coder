Your solution should aim to maximize performance, but it does not need to be perfect or optimal; any noticeable improvement over the original implementation is acceptable. Feel free to experiment with different approaches such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or even changing the data layout for better cache locality. However, keep in mind that excessive complexity might outweigh the benefits gained from optimization. ```
