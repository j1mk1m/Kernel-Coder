Your implementation should aim for performance improvements over the original PyTorch implementation, especially when dealing with large batch sizes and high-dimensional data. Consider using techniques such as fused operations, shared memory optimization, and efficient memory access patterns to achieve these improvements. 

Please also provide a brief explanation of the optimizations you made and how they contribute to improved performance.
