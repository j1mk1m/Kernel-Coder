The goal is to achieve the highest possible performance improvement over the original implementation using CUDA kernels. Feel free to use any CUDA programming techniques, such as shared memory, coalesced memory access, etc., to optimize the performance of your custom CUDA kernels. You may also explore alternative algorithms for Max Pooling 2D, such as online pooling or other optimizations that could further improve performance.
