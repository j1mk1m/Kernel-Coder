Please use the `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` function to compile the custom CUDA kernels. Be sure to define the appropriate CUDA kernels and include any necessary headers. Ensure the new architecture is fully compatible with PyTorch's tensor operations and can be used interchangeably with the original model.
