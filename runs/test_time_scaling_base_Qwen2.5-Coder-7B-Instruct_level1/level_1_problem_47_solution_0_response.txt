### Guidelines:

- Your implementation should be efficient in terms of both time and memory usage.
- Use PyTorch's `load_inline` function to compile and link your custom CUDA kernels.
- Ensure that the `forward` method of your `ModelNew` class correctly applies the sum reduction using the custom CUDA kernel.
- Make sure the dimensions of the input tensor and the output tensor match as per the original `Model`.
- Include any necessary imports at the beginning of your code snippet.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure readability of the code.
