Here's a hint on how to approach this task:

1. Identify which operations can be accelerated using custom CUDA kernels.
2. Write the CUDA kernel for these operations.
3. Replace the PyTorch operations with the custom CUDA kernels in the ModelNew class.
4. Ensure that the architecture still produces the correct output.
5. Test the new architecture to ensure it works as expected.

Remember to include all necessary imports at the beginning of your code snippet. Your solution should demonstrate a significant performance improvement over the original Model.
