Please follow the same pattern as shown in the example above. 

Make sure that your implementation uses the appropriate CUDA API calls and handles memory allocation/deallocation correctly. Also, ensure that the kernel function is properly defined and launched with the correct grid and block dimensions. Finally, make sure that the output tensor has the correct shape and data type. 

Remember that you can use any CUDA features you see fit, such as shared memory, texture memory, or atomic operations, to optimize the performance of your custom kernel. However, be aware that these features come with their own trade-offs, so use them judiciously. 

Good luck!
