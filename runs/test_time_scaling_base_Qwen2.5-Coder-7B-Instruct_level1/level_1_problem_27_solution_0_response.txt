Please provide your solution in python using torch and torch.nn. Your solution should include the definition of the `ModelNew` class, which inherits from `nn.Module`. The `forward` method of `ModelNew` should implement the SELU operation using a custom CUDA kernel. The `get_inputs` and `get_init_inputs` functions should remain unchanged. Ensure that the `torch.selu` function is not used anywhere in the provided code.
