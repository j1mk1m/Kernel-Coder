Please do not optimize any other operations apart from the transposed 2D convolution. You should aim to achieve maximum performance for this specific operation. 

### Guidelines:
- Your solution must be fully self-contained and include all necessary imports.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA operator correctly implements the functionality of the original PyTorch operation.
- Optimize the performance of the transposed 2D convolution using CUDA parallelism.
- Avoid unnecessary memory copies between CPU and GPU.
- Document your code with comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
- Ensure that the new architecture maintains the same interface as the original (`forward` method takes the same arguments and returns the same result).

### Example of how to use the custom CUDA operator:

```python
model_new = ModelNew(in_channels=in_channels, out_channels=out_channels, kernel_size=kernel_size)
input_tensor = get_inputs()[0]
output_tensor = model_new(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape)  # Should print: torch.Size([8, 64, 512, 512])
```

### Hints:
- Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
- Experiment with different block sizes and grid sizes to find the optimal configuration for your hardware.
- Use cooperative groups to improve thread synchronization and occupancy.
- Profile your implementation to identify bottlenecks and areas for further optimization.
