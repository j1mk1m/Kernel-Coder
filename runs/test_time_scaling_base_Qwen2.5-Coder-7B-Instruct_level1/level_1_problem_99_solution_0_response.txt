Your solution should aim to optimize performance, especially for large batch sizes and high-dimensional inputs. Feel free to use any CUDA optimization techniques such as shared memory, coalesced memory access, and efficient memory transfer. Consider operator fusion and algorithmic optimizations as well. 

Please provide the full implementation of `ModelNew` including the necessary imports, CUDA kernels, and any other helper functions or classes. Ensure that the `forward` method returns the same result as the original `Model`. ```python
