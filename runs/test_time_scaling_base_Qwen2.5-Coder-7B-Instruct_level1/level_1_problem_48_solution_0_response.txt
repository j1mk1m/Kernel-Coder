Please include any additional helper functions or classes that are needed to support your implementation. Your solution should focus on optimizing performance by replacing PyTorch operators with custom CUDA kernels. Make sure to comment on your choices and explain why they were made. 

Your solution must be different from the provided example. Feel free to combine multiple operators, use operator fusion, or apply algorithmic optimizations as needed. 

Remember, the goal is to achieve maximum performance by leveraging CUDA parallelism and avoiding unnecessary data transfers between CPU and GPU.

Here is one possible way to approach the problem:

- Identify the PyTorch operator that can benefit most from a custom CUDA kernel. In this case, it might be the `mean` operation since it involves a large amount of data and can be parallelized effectively.
- Write a custom CUDA kernel for the `mean` operation. This kernel will compute the mean of elements along a specified dimension in parallel.
- Replace the PyTorch `mean` operator with the custom CUDA kernel in the `forward` method of the `Model` class.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel handles edge cases such as empty dimensions or non-contiguous tensors.
- Test the optimized architecture to ensure that it produces the correct results and has improved performance compared to the original architecture.

Please provide the optimized code in the response. Remember to follow all guidelines and constraints mentioned above. ```
