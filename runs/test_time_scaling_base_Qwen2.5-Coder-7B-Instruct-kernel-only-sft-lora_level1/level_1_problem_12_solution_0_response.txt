### Requirements:
- Use a custom CUDA kernel for the `@` operation.
- Ensure the kernel handles the matrix multiplication efficiently.
- Optimize the kernel for large matrices (e.g., N=4096, M=4096).
- Document any optimizations used in the comments within the code.
- Make sure the resulting architecture (`ModelNew`) is completely functional and can be used interchangeably with the original (`Model`).
