Please note that you can use any libraries from PyTorch or CUDA to assist you with the implementation, but you cannot use any pre-built PyTorch operators that perform the same function as the ones you are replacing. For example, if you are replacing a matrix multiplication with a custom CUDA kernel, you cannot use the `@` operator or `torch.matmul` in your custom kernel.

Here is an example of how you might start implementing a custom CUDA kernel for transposed 1D convolution:

```python
# Example CUDA source code for transposed 1D convolution
transposed_1d_conv_source = """
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Define your custom CUDA kernel here
__global__ void transposed_1d_conv_kernel(...) {
    // Kernel logic here
}

torch::Tensor transposed_1d_conv_cuda(torch::Tensor x, ...) {
    // Setup and launch kernel
    ...
    return output_tensor;
}
"""

# Load the inline CUDA code
transposed_1d_conv = load_inline(
    name="transposed_1d_conv",
    cpp_sources="torch::Tensor transposed_1d_conv_cuda(torch::Tensor x, ...);",
    cuda_sources=transposed_1d_conv_source,
    functions=["transposed_1d_conv_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, dilation, bias):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.transposed_1d_conv = transposed_1d_conv

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.transposed_1d_conv.transposed_1d_conv_cuda(x, ...)
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders in the example with actual code that implements the transposed 1D convolution using a custom CUDA kernel.
