### Constraints:
- Your solution must use PyTorch's `load_inline` function to define and compile the custom CUDA kernel.
- You can choose any subset of operations to optimize with custom CUDA kernels.
- Feel free to combine multiple operations into a single kernel or apply other optimizations.
- The final architecture should maintain the same functionality as the original `Model`.

### Deliverables:
- A fully functional Python script implementing `ModelNew`.
- The script should include all necessary imports and definitions.
- The script should compile and run without errors.
