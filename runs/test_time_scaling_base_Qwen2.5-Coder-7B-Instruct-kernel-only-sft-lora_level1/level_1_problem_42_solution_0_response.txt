Your solution should aim to maximize performance gains by utilizing CUDA parallelism effectively. Be creative in how you combine operations or change algorithms to achieve better performance. For instance, you might decide to implement a more efficient version of max pooling using shared memory or other techniques. Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools as needed to help achieve your goal.
