### Requirements:
- Replace the 3D transposed convolution operation with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernel maintains the same functionality as the original PyTorch operator.
- Optimize the performance of the 3D transposed convolution operation using the custom CUDA kernel.
- The custom CUDA kernel should be implemented in C++ and CUDA.
- The custom CUDA kernel should be compiled and loaded dynamically using PyTorch's `load_inline` function.
- The optimized architecture should maintain the same API as the original architecture (`Model`).
- The custom CUDA kernel should be efficient and handle edge cases such as varying batch sizes and different kernel sizes.

Please provide the full implementation of the optimized architecture in C++ and CUDA, including the custom CUDA kernel and the Python wrapper code to load it dynamically using `load_inline`. ```
