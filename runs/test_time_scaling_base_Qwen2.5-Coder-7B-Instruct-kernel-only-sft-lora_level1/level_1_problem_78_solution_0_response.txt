Please ensure that your custom CUDA implementation is efficient and follows best practices for parallelization and memory access patterns. Feel free to experiment with different algorithms and optimizations, such as using shared memory, coalesced memory accesses, and warp-synchronous programming. However, do not overcomplicate the code; prioritize simplicity and readability while achieving performance gains.
