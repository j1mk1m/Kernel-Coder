Here is a hint on how to approach this problem:

- Use `load_inline` from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile the CUDA kernels.
- Write the CUDA kernels for the ELU operation.
- Replace the PyTorch ELU operator with your custom CUDA implementation in the `forward` method of `ModelNew`.
- Ensure that the input and output shapes match between the original PyTorch implementation and your custom CUDA implementation.
