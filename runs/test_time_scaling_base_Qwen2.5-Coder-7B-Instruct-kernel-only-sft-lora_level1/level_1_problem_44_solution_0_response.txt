The goal here is to use CUDA to accelerate the computation of the 1D average pooling operation. You can either implement a custom CUDA kernel for 1D average pooling, or use an existing library function that supports CUDA acceleration. If you decide to implement a custom CUDA kernel, be sure to follow best practices for parallel programming and memory access patterns. If you decide to use an existing library function, be sure to carefully evaluate its performance characteristics and ensure it meets the requirements of your application. ```
