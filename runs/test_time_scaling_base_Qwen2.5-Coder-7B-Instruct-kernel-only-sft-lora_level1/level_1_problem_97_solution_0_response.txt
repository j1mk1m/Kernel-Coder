Here are the steps you should follow:

- Choose which PyTorch operators to replace with custom CUDA kernels.
- Write the CUDA kernels for these operators.
- Load the CUDA kernels into your model.
- Replace the original PyTorch operators with your custom CUDA kernels.
- Ensure that the new architecture produces the same results as the original architecture.

Please note that the goal is to achieve performance improvements through custom CUDA implementations, so feel free to experiment with different approaches such as operator fusion, algorithmic optimizations, etc.
