Please note that the goal is to optimize the performance of the model, so you should aim to implement efficient CUDA kernels for the operations used in the original model. If there are multiple ways to achieve the same result, feel free to choose the one that you believe will be most performant. Remember that the efficiency of the implementation can depend on factors such as the size of the input data, the number of threads and blocks used in the CUDA kernel, and the memory hierarchy of the GPU.

Also note that you should avoid using libraries such as cuDNN or other high-level libraries that provide pre-optimized implementations of common operations, as the goal is to implement custom CUDA kernels. Instead, you should use the CUDA programming model directly to implement the operations you need. This means writing CUDA C++ code that uses the CUDA runtime API to launch kernels and manage memory.

Finally, please make sure that your implementation is correct and produces the same results as the original model. You can do this by comparing the outputs of the original and optimized models on the same input data. ```
