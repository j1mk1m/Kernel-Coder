Note: Your solution should provide a significant speedup over the original PyTorch implementation, ideally at least 2x faster. Feel free to use any techniques you see fit, such as operator fusion, algorithmic optimizations, or custom CUDA kernels. Make sure to include detailed comments explaining your choices and the reasoning behind them.
