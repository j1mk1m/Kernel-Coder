Please note that I'm looking for a significant performance improvement over the original implementation, so aim for substantial optimizations. Feel free to use any optimization techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or even using different types of CUDA kernels if necessary. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible throughput while maintaining correctness.
