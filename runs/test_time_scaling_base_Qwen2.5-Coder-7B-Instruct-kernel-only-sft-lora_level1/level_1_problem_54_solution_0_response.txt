Please follow the syntax shown in the example above. Be sure to include any necessary imports and define the CUDA source code for each custom operator. Make sure to compile the inline CUDA code using the appropriate function from PyTorch. Finally, ensure that the new architecture uses the custom CUDA operators in its forward method.
