**Note:** Your custom CUDA operators should be implemented in C++ and CUDA, and should be loaded using PyTorch's `load_inline` function. You can use any CUDA features to optimize performance, such as shared memory, texture caching, etc. Make sure that your custom CUDA operators are correctly integrated into the PyTorch model architecture.
