Please ensure that the final output code is completely self-contained. It should include all necessary imports, definitions, and any additional code required to run the model. 

Make sure to optimize the matrix multiplication operation within the forward method. You can use techniques such as shared memory optimization, strided access, or other CUDA-specific optimizations to improve performance.
