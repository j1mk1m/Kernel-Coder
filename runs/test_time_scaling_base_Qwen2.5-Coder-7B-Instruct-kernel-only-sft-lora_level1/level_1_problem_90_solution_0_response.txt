Here is a list of PyTorch operators that can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels:

- cumprod
- cumsum
- add
- mul
- relu
- sigmoid
- tanh
- log_softmax
- softmax
- max_pool1d
- max_pool2d
- avg_pool1d
- avg_pool2d
- conv1d
- conv2d
- batch_norm
- dropout
- layer_norm
- adaptive_avg_pool1d
- adaptive_avg_pool2d
- adaptive_max_pool1d
- adaptive_max_pool2d

Please optimize the architecture using any combination of these operators. Feel free to use operator fusion or algorithmic changes to achieve better performance. Your goal is to create a faster implementation of the model. ```
