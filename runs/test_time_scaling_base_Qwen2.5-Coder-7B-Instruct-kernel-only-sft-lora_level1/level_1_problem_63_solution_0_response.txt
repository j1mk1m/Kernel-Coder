The optimization should be focused on reducing the computational cost of the 2D convolution operation using CUDA kernels. Feel free to explore different techniques such as algorithmic optimizations, parallelization strategies, memory access patterns, etc. The goal is to achieve faster execution times compared to the original PyTorch implementation.
