Make sure to provide the full implementation of the ModelNew class along with any necessary imports. If there are any additional files needed to compile the CUDA code, please include them as well. 

Please optimize at least one operator in the architecture. Feel free to use operator fusion or other techniques to further improve performance. Provide a brief explanation of why you chose to optimize that particular operator.
