### Constraints:
- Only use custom CUDA kernels for optimizing the model, no other optimization techniques such as mixed precision, quantization, etc.
- You must provide a full implementation of `ModelNew` including all necessary imports and the `get_inputs()` function.
- Ensure that the functionality of the original `Model` remains intact, i.e., applying Layer Normalization to the input tensor.
- Your solution should aim to maximize performance by leveraging GPU parallelism.
