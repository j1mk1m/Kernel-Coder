### Note: 
- Only use custom CUDA kernels for specific operations that would benefit from GPU acceleration. For example, large matrix multiplications, convolutions, etc. 
- Avoid using custom CUDA kernels for simple operations such as element-wise addition or multiplication. These can often be done more efficiently using PyTorch's built-in operators.
- Consider operator fusion opportunities and algorithmic changes to further optimize performance. 
- Make sure that the custom CUDA kernels handle edge cases correctly, such as varying batch sizes or different kernel sizes. 
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernels maintain numerical stability and accuracy.
