Here's a hint on how to approach it: You can start by identifying the most computationally intensive operations in the architecture. For the provided architecture, the transposed 2D convolution is likely to be the most expensive operation. You can then look into optimizing this operation using a custom CUDA kernel. Remember that the goal is to achieve faster execution times while maintaining the same functionality as the original architecture. Be creative in your approach and don't hesitate to experiment with different algorithms and optimizations. Good luck!

Please note that the solution should be efficient and well-optimized for both CPU and GPU. The code should also be easy to read and maintain. Make sure to follow best practices for writing high-performance CUDA code.
