### Requirements:
- Replace the transposed 2D convolution with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Ensure that the kernel handles the same functionality as the original PyTorch operation.
- Optimize the kernel for performance.
- Keep the overall structure of the model intact.
- Use appropriate CUDA data types and memory management practices.
