Please ensure that you optimize the performance of the Model by replacing one or more of its operators with custom CUDA kernels. You should aim to improve the execution time of the model on a GPU compared to using PyTorch's default implementation. 

Remember to use the `load_inline` function from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile and load the custom CUDA kernels. Ensure that the custom kernels are properly integrated into the `ModelNew` class.

Here's a hint: Consider optimizing the 2D convolution operation, which is computationally intensive and can benefit significantly from custom CUDA kernels. You can explore various optimization techniques such as shared memory usage, coalesced memory access patterns, and algorithmic improvements like grouped convolutions.
