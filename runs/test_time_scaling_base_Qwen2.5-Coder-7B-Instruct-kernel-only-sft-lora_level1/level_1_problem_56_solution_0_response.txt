Here are the guidelines for the optimization:

- Replace the 2D convolution (`nn.Conv2d`) with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Ensure that the kernel handles the specified parameters (`stride`, `padding`, `dilation`, `groups`, `bias`).
- Make sure the kernel is efficient and performs well on GPU.
- If possible, fuse multiple operations into a single kernel to improve performance.
- Use appropriate data types and memory layouts to optimize the kernel.

Please provide the optimized code in the requested format.
