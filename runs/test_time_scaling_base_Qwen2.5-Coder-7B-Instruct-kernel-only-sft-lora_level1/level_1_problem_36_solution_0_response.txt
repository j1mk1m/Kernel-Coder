### Guidelines:

1. You must provide a working implementation of `ModelNew` which replaces parts of the original `Model` with custom CUDA kernels.
2. Your solution should be efficient and take advantage of GPU parallelism.
3. Feel free to add any additional helper functions or classes as needed.
4. Ensure that the new model behaves identically to the original model in terms of functionality.
5. Use appropriate CUDA memory management practices (e.g., pinned memory).
6. Optimize the performance of the RMS normalization operation using techniques such as fused operations, shared memory, etc.
