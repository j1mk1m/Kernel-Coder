Here are some considerations when optimizing the Model:

- Use efficient CUDA algorithms for the transposed 3D convolution.
- Consider using custom CUDA kernels for specific parts of the operation that can be parallelized effectively.
- Optimize memory access patterns for better performance on the GPU.
- Optionally, implement algorithmic improvements such as fused operations or alternative convolution strategies.
