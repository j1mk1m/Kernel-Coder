### Hints:

- Consider using PyTorch's `load_inline` function to compile and load your custom CUDA kernels.
- Think about how you can optimize the 4D tensor-matrix multiplication operation (`torch.einsum("bijl,lk->bijk", A, B)`).
- You might want to look into algorithms that can reduce memory bandwidth usage or parallelize the computation further.
- Feel free to experiment with different approaches such as operator fusion, algorithmic optimizations, etc.
- Make sure your implementation works correctly for all possible input shapes and sizes.
- Ensure that your custom CUDA kernels are well-optimized and efficient.
- If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for help or clarification.
