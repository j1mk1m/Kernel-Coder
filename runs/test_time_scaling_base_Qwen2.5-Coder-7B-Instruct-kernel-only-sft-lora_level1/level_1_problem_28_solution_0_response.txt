Hint: Look at the implementation of `torch.nn.functional.hardsigmoid` to understand what it does and how it can be implemented efficiently using CUDA.

**Note:** You must use PyTorch's `load_inline` function to compile and load the CUDA kernel. Make sure all necessary headers and flags are included for proper compilation. The resulting CUDA kernel should be efficient and well-optimized for the given operation.

**Additional Challenge:** Consider optimizing further by combining the HardSigmoid operation with other operations if possible. For instance, if there were another operation immediately following the HardSigmoid, you could fuse them into a single kernel for better performance. However, this part is optional and not required. Focus primarily on optimizing the HardSigmoid operation itself.
