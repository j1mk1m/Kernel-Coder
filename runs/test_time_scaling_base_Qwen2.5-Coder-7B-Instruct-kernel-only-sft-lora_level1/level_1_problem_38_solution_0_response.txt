Here are some tips:

- Consider using fused operations where possible to reduce the number of kernel calls.
- Use efficient memory access patterns in your CUDA kernels.
- Be mindful of memory allocation and deallocation overheads.
- Optimize for both GPU utilization and throughput.
- Avoid unnecessary data copies between host and device.
- If applicable, use algorithms that are more efficient on GPUs than their CPU counterparts.
- Ensure that the resulting architecture maintains the same functionality as the original one.

Remember to include any necessary imports at the beginning of your code. Your solution should be a complete, runnable piece of code.
