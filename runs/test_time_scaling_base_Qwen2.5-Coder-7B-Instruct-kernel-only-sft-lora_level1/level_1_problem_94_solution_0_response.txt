Please follow the same structure as the example provided. You should include the necessary imports at the beginning of your code. Make sure that the `ModelNew` class has a `forward` method that performs the same computation as the original `Model` class but using custom CUDA operators where possible. Additionally, ensure that any additional classes or functions needed to implement the custom CUDA operators are included within the `ModelNew` class or in separate modules.
