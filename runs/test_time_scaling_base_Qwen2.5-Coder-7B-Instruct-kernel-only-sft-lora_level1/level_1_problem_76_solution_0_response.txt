Please ensure that the solution is efficient and utilizes CUDA capabilities to achieve significant performance improvements over the original PyTorch implementation. 

Consider optimizing the convolution operation using techniques such as fused operations, specialized algorithms, or custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to experiment with different approaches and evaluate their impact on performance. 

Note: Ensure that the final implementation maintains the same functionality as the original model, producing equivalent outputs for the same inputs.
