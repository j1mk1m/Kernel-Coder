Please do not use any pre-existing CUDA libraries such as cuDNN or other high-level deep learning frameworks. Only use PyTorch's CUDA capabilities. Make sure all operations are correctly implemented using CUDA kernels. 

Also, please include the necessary imports at the beginning of the code. 

Finally, please ensure that the architecture can handle the same inputs as the original architecture without modification. 

Note: The provided architecture does not require any specific optimization since it is already using PyTorch's built-in convolutional layer. However, you should still aim to create a version that utilizes custom CUDA kernels for better performance.
