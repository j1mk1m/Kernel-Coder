### Note:
- You can assume that the input tensors will always be on the GPU.
- Your custom CUDA kernel should be efficient and handle large batch sizes and matrices.
- Feel free to experiment with different algorithms or optimizations such as using shared memory, asynchronous execution, etc. but ensure they improve performance.
- The goal is to achieve significant speedup compared to the original PyTorch implementation.
