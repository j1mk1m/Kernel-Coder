### Constraints:

- Only use custom CUDA kernels to replace the PyTorch operators. Do not modify the existing class structure or method signatures.
- Ensure that the functionality of the original `Model` remains unchanged after optimization.
- Use appropriate error handling and memory management in your custom CUDA kernels.
- Optimize for both throughput and latency where possible.
- Ensure compatibility with different GPU architectures (e.g., NVIDIA Ampere, Volta, Turing, etc.).

### Hints:

- Consider using cuDNN for highly optimized convolution operations.
- Explore parallelization techniques such as shared memory and coalesced memory access patterns.
- Utilize efficient data transfer between CPU and GPU.

### Expected Output:

Provide the optimized code for `ModelNew` in Python using CUDA. The code should be fully functional and optimize the performance of the transposed 1D convolution operation.
