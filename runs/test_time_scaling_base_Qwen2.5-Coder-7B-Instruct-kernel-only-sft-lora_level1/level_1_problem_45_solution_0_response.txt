### Requirements:

- Use at least one custom CUDA kernel to replace any part of the `Model` class.
- Feel free to combine multiple operations into a single kernel, such as fusing Average Pooling with other operations.
- Ensure that the `forward` method remains compatible with the original model architecture.
- Document any changes made to improve performance.
