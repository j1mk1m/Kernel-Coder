The resulting architecture should be able to perform 2D Average Pooling faster than the original implementation using PyTorch operators. 

Please provide the full code for `ModelNew` and any other necessary components, including any additional CUDA source files if needed. Ensure that the code is well-commented and follows best practices for CUDA programming.
