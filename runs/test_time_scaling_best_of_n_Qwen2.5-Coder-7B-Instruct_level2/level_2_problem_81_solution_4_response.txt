Make sure to document your choices and explain why you chose certain operators to replace with custom CUDA kernels.

**NOTE:** Your implementation should be able to handle the same input dimensions and produce the same output as the original `Model`. You can use any additional libraries you need from PyTorch or CUDA. You can also define helper functions or classes if needed. However, ensure that the final output architecture is contained within the provided code blocks.
