Please note that I am looking for a significant performance improvement over the original model, so try to optimize both the computation and memory access patterns. If possible, use operator fusion or other techniques to reduce the number of GPU operations.

Here is a hint to start off with: Consider optimizing the Mish activation function, which can be computationally expensive due to its definition involving exponentials. Implementing a more efficient version of Mish could significantly speed up the model.

For additional hints, you might want to look into how PyTorch implements certain operations internally, especially those related to convolutional layers and activations. Understanding their optimizations can provide insights into how to improve your own implementation.

Good luck!
