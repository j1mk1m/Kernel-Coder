Please note that I'm asking you to provide a solution using PyTorch extensions, not ONNX Runtime or any other framework.

**NOTE**: For simplicity, assume that all inputs are already in GPU memory, and there is no need to handle data transfer between CPU and GPU. Also, feel free to use any additional libraries or tools that might help in optimizing the model further.
