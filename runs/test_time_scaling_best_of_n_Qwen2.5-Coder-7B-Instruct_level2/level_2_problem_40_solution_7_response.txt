Please follow the syntax provided in the example above. Replace the `forward` method of the `ModelNew` class with your custom CUDA implementation. Ensure that the `__init__` method remains unchanged. Your custom CUDA implementation should aim to optimize the performance of the matrix multiplication, scaling, and residual addition operations. Feel free to combine these operations into a single kernel or use other optimization techniques such as fused kernels or algorithmic changes.

### Note: You must provide a valid PyTorch CUDA extension using `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline`. The custom CUDA kernel should be implemented in C++ and CUDA. Ensure that all necessary headers are included and that the kernel is correctly defined and invoked within the `forward` method of `ModelNew`.
