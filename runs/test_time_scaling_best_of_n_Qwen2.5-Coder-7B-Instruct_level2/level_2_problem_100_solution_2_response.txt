The goal is to provide a fully functional implementation of ModelNew using custom CUDA operators where possible.

## Constraints:

- Your solution must be completely self-contained within the provided framework. No external libraries or packages should be used other than those available in PyTorch and CUDA.
- Your solution must compile and run without errors. It is acceptable if the performance improvement is not significant due to various factors such as overheads, but the code should work correctly.
- Your solution must maintain the functionality of the original model. The output of ModelNew should be identical to the output of Model when run on the same inputs.
- Your solution must demonstrate creativity in optimizing the model. For example, you could fuse multiple operations into a single kernel, use more efficient algorithms, or implement optimizations at the hardware level.
