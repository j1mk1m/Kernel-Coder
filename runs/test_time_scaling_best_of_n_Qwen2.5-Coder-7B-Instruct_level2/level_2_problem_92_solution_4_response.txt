Here are the steps to follow:

1. Identify the PyTorch operators that can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels.
2. Write the CUDA kernels for these operators.
3. Compile the CUDA kernels using `load_inline`.
4. Replace the PyTorch operators with the custom CUDA kernels in the `ModelNew` class.

Make sure that the `forward` method of `ModelNew` returns the same output as the original `Model`. If necessary, adjust the dimensions and shapes of the tensors to ensure compatibility.
