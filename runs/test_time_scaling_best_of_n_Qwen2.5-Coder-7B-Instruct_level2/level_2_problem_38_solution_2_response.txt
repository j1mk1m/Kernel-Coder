Please note that while I do provide sample inputs for the original `Model`, these should not be used when generating the `ModelNew` code. Instead, use generic dummy inputs of appropriate shapes to validate that the operations are performed correctly.

The goal is to maximize performance by replacing PyTorch operators with custom CUDA kernels where possible, but the accuracy of the model must remain the same.
