Here are some hints:

- You can use `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` to compile and load your custom CUDA kernels.
- You can define custom CUDA kernels for each operation (Gemm, Subtract, GlobalAvgPool, LogSumExp, GELU, and ResidualAdd).
- You can combine multiple operations into a single kernel if it makes sense.
- You can use algorithmic optimizations such as inplace operations to reduce memory usage.
- Make sure to handle edge cases and ensure the correctness of your implementation.

Please note that the provided code snippets are examples and should be adapted to fit the specific requirements of the given architecture.
