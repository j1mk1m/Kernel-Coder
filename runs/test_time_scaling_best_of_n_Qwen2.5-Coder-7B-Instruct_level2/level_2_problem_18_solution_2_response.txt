Here is a reference solution for comparison:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = torch.sum(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)
        x = torch.max(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)[0]
        x = torch.mean(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)
        x = torch.logsumexp(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)
        x = torch.logsumexp(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)
        return x

def get_inputs():
    batch_size = 1024
    in_features  = 8192  
    out_features = 8192
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, in_features)]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [in_features, out_features]

```

Please note that your optimized version should be faster than the reference solution.
