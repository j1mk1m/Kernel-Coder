Here's an example of how the outputs should look like:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the custom CUDA kernel for transposed 3D convolution
transposed_convolution_source = """
// Your CUDA kernel code here
"""

transposed_convolution_cpp_source = (
    // Your C++ source code here
)

# Compile the inline CUDA code for transposed 3D convolution
transposed_convolution = load_inline(
    name="transposed_convolution",
    cpp_sources=transposed_convolution_cpp_source,
    cuda_sources=transposed_convolution_source,
    functions=["transposed_convolution_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)

# Repeat the process for other operators

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, scale, maxpool_kernel_size):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.transposed_convolution = transposed_convolution
        # Initialize other custom CUDA operators similarly

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.transposed_convolution.transposed_convolution_cuda(x, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding)
        # Apply other custom CUDA operators similarly
        return x
```

```cpp
// Your CUDA kernel implementation in C++
```

Ensure that each operator has its own CUDA kernel and corresponding C++ wrapper function. Make sure the new architecture `ModelNew` is fully functional and produces the same output as the original `Model`.
