```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your custom CUDA kernels go here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        # Initialize your custom CUDA kernels here

    def forward(self, x):
        # Use your custom CUDA kernels here
        pass
```

```python
def get_inputs():
    # Generate inputs for your optimized model here
    pass

def get_init_inputs():
    # Generate initialization inputs for your optimized model here
    pass
```

Please ensure that the `get_inputs()` and `get_init_inputs()` functions return the correct data types and shapes as expected by the `ModelNew` class. Also, please make sure that the `forward()` method correctly implements the operations defined in the original `Model` class using your custom CUDA kernels.
