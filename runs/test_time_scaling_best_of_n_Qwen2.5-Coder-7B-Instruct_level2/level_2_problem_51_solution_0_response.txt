Hint: Consider replacing the Gemm operation with a more efficient implementation, such as using cuBLAS or writing a custom kernel. Also, look into optimizing the other operations, such as Subtract, GlobalAvgPool, LogSumExp, GELU, and ResidualAdd, by leveraging CUDA intrinsics or writing custom kernels. 

Note: The solution should be implemented in Python using PyTorch and CUDA. The code should be self-contained and clear. The solution should also include the necessary imports and any additional setup required to run the code. ```python
't ```cpp
