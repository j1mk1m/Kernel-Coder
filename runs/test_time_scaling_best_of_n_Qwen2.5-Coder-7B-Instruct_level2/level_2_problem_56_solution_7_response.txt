Please note that the optimization can include but is not limited to:

- Custom CUDA kernels for operations such as linear (matrix multiplication), sigmoid activation, and sum reduction.
- Operator fusion where possible to reduce the number of GPU calls.
- Algorithmic improvements such as using efficient sum reduction techniques.

Make sure that the outputted ModelNew class has the same functionality as the original Model class but potentially runs faster due to the use of custom CUDA operators.
