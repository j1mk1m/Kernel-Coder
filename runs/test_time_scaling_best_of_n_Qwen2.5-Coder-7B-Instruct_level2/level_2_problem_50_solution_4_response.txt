Please note that this is a complex task, so it is okay to focus on optimizing a subset of the operations. For instance, you might decide to optimize the conv_transpose operation but leave the other operations unchanged. Be mindful of the trade-offs between performance gains and complexity introduced by custom CUDA kernels.
