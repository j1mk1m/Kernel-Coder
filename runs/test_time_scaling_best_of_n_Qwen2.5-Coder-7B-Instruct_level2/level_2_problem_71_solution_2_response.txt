    Your solution should include any necessary imports, definitions, and modifications to the original architecture. Make sure the new architecture retains the same functionality as the original. If you decide to implement custom CUDA kernels for certain operations, ensure they are correctly integrated into the new architecture.

    You can use any libraries or tools available in PyTorch or CUDA ecosystem to assist with the optimization. Feel free to experiment with different approaches such as operator fusion, algorithmic optimizations, or using PyTorch extensions.

    Note: This question is open-ended and allows for creative solutions. The goal is to achieve performance improvements through custom CUDA implementations. Be mindful of trade-offs between implementation complexity and potential speedup gains.
