Your solution should include the custom CUDA kernels for the operations that can be accelerated using CUDA. Feel free to optimize any part of the architecture including but not limited to:

- Replacing the 3D convolution operation with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Combining the Mish and Tanh activations into a single CUDA kernel.
- Using alternative algorithms for the Mish and Tanh activations.

Ensure that the `get_inputs` and `get_init_inputs` functions remain unchanged. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible performance improvement by leveraging CUDA acceleration wherever feasible.
