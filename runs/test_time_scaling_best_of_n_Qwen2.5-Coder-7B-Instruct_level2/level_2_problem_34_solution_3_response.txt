### Note: 
- You should use `load_inline` from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile the custom CUDA kernels. 
- Feel free to replace any part of the architecture with a custom CUDA kernel. For example, you can replace the 3D transposed convolution, layer normalization, GELU activation, or scaling with a custom CUDA kernel. 
- Consider operator fusion opportunities, such as combining multiple operations into a single kernel. 
- Feel free to modify the architecture as needed to achieve the best performance.

### Expected Output: 
```python
# Your optimized ModelNew class here
```
