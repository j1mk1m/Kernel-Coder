Please note that the goal is to achieve maximum performance improvements through custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to optimize any part of the architecture, including but not limited to the conv_transpose operation, GELU activation, and GroupNorm layer. Consider algorithmic changes and operator fusion opportunities as well.
