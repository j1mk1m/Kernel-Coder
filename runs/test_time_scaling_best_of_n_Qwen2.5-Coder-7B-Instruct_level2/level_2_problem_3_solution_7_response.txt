Please follow the same structure as the previous example, where you define the CUDA kernel(s) and then create a new class `ModelNew` that uses these kernels.

### Note:
- Feel free to replace any combination of operations with custom CUDA kernels.
- Consider operator fusion opportunities.
- Use efficient algorithms where possible.
- Ensure the final implementation is correct and performs the same computation as the original model.
