Here is an example of how the `get_inputs` function should look for the new architecture:

```python
def get_inputs():
    # randomly generate input tensors based on the model architecture
    batch_size = 1024
    in_features = 8192
    x = torch.randn(batch_size, in_features).cuda()
    return [x]
```

Please note that the `get_init_inputs` function does not need to be changed.

The new architecture should use custom CUDA operators wherever possible to achieve the highest performance gains. Be creative with operator fusion and algorithmic optimizations. For example, combining multiple activation functions into a single kernel or using more efficient algorithms for certain operations. The goal is to optimize the entire pipeline for maximum throughput. 

Please ensure that all operations are correctly implemented and that the new architecture produces the same results as the original one. Additionally, please provide any necessary documentation or comments within the code to explain any complex optimizations or choices made during the process.
