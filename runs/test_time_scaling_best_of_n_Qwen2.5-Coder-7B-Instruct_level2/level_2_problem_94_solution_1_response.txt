Your code should be well-commented and follow best practices. Make sure all imports are included at the beginning of the file.

Here is the reference implementation:

```python
model_new = ModelNew(*get_init_inputs())
inputs = get_inputs()
output = model_new(inputs[0])
print(output.shape)
```

Please ensure your final output is runnable without any errors. If you encounter any issues during compilation or execution, please provide the error messages along with your solution.
