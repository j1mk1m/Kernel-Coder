```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your custom CUDA code here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, pool_kernel_size):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize your custom layers here

    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement your forward pass using custom CUDA operators
        return x
```

Your implementation should aim to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining correctness. Consider optimizing the convolution operation, average pooling, sigmoid activation, and sum reduction.

Please note that you can use any additional libraries or tools from PyTorch or other open-source projects as needed, but ensure that the final implementation is self-contained within the provided code blocks.
