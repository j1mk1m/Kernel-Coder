Please include any relevant imports at the top of the codeblock. If necessary, define helper functions or classes within the `ModelNew` class.

### Constraints:
- Use PyTorch's `load_inline` function to compile the custom CUDA code.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA implementation maintains the same behavior as the original PyTorch operations.
- Consider optimizing both the computation and memory access patterns.
- Feel free to use any CUDA best practices or optimization techniques.

## Expected Output:
The expected output should be a fully functional PyTorch module named `ModelNew` that implements the same functionality as `Model`, but uses custom CUDA kernels for the GEMM, Group Normalization, Minimum operation, and Bias addition. The custom CUDA kernels should be compiled using PyTorch's `load_inline` function.

Please note that the actual performance gain will depend on the specific hardware and workload characteristics. The goal is to demonstrate the potential for performance improvement through custom CUDA implementations.
