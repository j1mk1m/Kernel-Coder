Here are some tips to help you get started:

- Choose which operators to optimize based on their computational intensity and potential for parallelization.
- Consider algorithmic optimizations such as fused operations (e.g., combining matrix multiplication and ReLU).
- Ensure that the custom CUDA operators handle edge cases correctly, such as when the input tensor sizes are not multiples of the block size.
- Test the performance of your custom operators using a profiler to ensure they provide the expected speedup.

Good luck!
