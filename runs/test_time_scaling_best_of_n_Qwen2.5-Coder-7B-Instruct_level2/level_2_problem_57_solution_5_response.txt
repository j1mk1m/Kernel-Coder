### Constraints:
- Your solution must be written in Python.
- You can use PyTorch's `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` to compile and load custom CUDA kernels.
- You should aim to achieve significant performance improvements over the original implementation.

### Example Solution:
Please provide a detailed solution with appropriate comments explaining your choices and optimizations.
