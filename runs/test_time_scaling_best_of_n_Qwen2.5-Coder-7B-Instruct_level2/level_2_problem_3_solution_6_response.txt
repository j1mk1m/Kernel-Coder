The code should be well-documented and include any necessary imports. Also, make sure that the code follows the same structure and naming conventions as the original code.

Note: Feel free to experiment with different operators and algorithms to achieve the best performance. The goal is to optimize the architecture as much as possible while maintaining its functionality.
