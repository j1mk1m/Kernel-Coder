The goal is to maximize performance, so feel free to combine operations, use efficient algorithms, and implement custom CUDA kernels where appropriate.

Please note that the `get_inputs` function should be able to handle the inputs for the `ModelNew` class, and the `get_init_inputs` function should provide the necessary parameters to initialize the `ModelNew` class.

### Note: 
- You can assume that all input tensors will fit into GPU memory.
- Feel free to add any additional helper functions or classes if needed.
- Make sure to follow best practices for CUDA programming and ensure the code is efficient and maintainable.
