The code should be designed to maximize performance while maintaining correctness. Feel free to use any CUDA optimization techniques such as shared memory, coalesced memory access, etc.

Please provide the optimized architecture `ModelNew` in Python using PyTorch and CUDA. Make sure all operations are either implemented in CUDA or are standard PyTorch operations that leverage efficient CPU/GPU implementations. ```python
