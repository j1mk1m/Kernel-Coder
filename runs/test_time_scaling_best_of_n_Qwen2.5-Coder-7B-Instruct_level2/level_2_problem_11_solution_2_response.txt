Note: Your implementation should be able to handle inputs of different sizes than the ones provided in the original model. However, for simplicity, feel free to assume that the input dimensions will always be divisible by the stride and padding values used in the model.

Also note that it's okay to change the order of operations or use other optimizations that don't directly correspond to the operations in the original model, as long as they improve performance. For instance, you could fuse multiple operations into a single CUDA kernel or implement a more efficient version of an operation using CUDA intrinsics or libraries such as cuDNN. 

Finally, please provide a brief explanation of any optimizations you made and why they were chosen. This can be done in a comment at the top of your code.
