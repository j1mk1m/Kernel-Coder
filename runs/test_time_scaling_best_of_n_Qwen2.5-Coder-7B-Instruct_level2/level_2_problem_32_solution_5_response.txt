The goal is to optimize the entire pipeline, including the convolution, scaling, and minimum operations. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of operators and algorithms. The primary objective is to achieve the highest possible performance.

### Hints:

- Consider using cuDNN for convolution operations.
- Explore efficient ways to implement the scaling operation.
- For the minimum operation, consider using a more efficient approach than `torch.min`.

### Additional Requirements:

- Ensure that the output shape remains consistent with the original architecture.
- Keep the interface of the `forward` method unchanged.

## Solution:

Provide the optimized architecture `ModelNew` with custom CUDA operators. The solution should be self-contained and include all necessary imports and definitions. Make sure the code is well-commented to explain any optimizations or algorithmic changes made. ```python
