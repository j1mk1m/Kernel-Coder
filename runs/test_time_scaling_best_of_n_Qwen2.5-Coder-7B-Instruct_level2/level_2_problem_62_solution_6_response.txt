Please ensure that the custom CUDA kernels are implemented correctly and efficiently. Consider optimizing for both memory bandwidth and computational efficiency. Also, ensure that the custom CUDA kernels handle edge cases such as empty tensors or tensors with different shapes. Finally, provide a brief explanation of your optimizations and how they improve the performance of the model.
