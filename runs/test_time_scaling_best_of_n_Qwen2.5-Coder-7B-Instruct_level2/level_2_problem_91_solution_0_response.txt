Please ensure that all custom CUDA kernels are well-documented and that the overall architecture remains consistent with the original functionality. If you decide to fuse multiple operators into a single kernel, clearly document the fused operations within the kernel comments.

### Additional Notes:
- Feel free to use any PyTorch operators in the `custom_operator_source` if they simplify the implementation of the fused operation.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernels handle edge cases and boundary conditions correctly.
- If you implement a custom version of a PyTorch operator, make sure it matches the behavior of the original operator as closely as possible.
- If you introduce any new parameters or variables, be sure to initialize them appropriately within the `ModelNew` class constructor.

Your solution should demonstrate a significant improvement in performance compared to the original architecture while maintaining the same functionality.
