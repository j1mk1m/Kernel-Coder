Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Identify which PyTorch operators can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels.
2. Write the CUDA kernels for these operators.
3. Load the CUDA kernels using `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline`.
4. Replace the PyTorch operators in the original model with the custom CUDA kernels.

Note: Feel free to optimize the architecture further by combining multiple operators into a single kernel or making other algorithmic changes. The goal is to achieve the highest possible performance while maintaining correctness.
