Here's a hint to help you get started: You can start by identifying which parts of the forward pass could benefit from custom CUDA kernels. For instance, matrix multiplication (`nn.Linear`) is often a good candidate for optimization due to its computational intensity. Once identified, you can proceed to implement these operations using CUDA. Remember to handle data transfers between CPU and GPU appropriately.
