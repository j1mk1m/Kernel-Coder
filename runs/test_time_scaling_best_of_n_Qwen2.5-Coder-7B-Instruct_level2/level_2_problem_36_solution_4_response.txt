Here are the constraints:

- You must use at least one custom CUDA operator in your optimization.
- You can optimize any part of the architecture including but not limited to the convolution transpose, min operation, sum operation, GELU activation, and addition.

Please note that the goal is to achieve the highest possible performance gain by leveraging CUDA parallelism. You should carefully design your custom CUDA kernels to maximize throughput and minimize memory bandwidth usage. Be mindful of potential issues such as bank conflicts and shared memory usage when optimizing your kernels. ```
