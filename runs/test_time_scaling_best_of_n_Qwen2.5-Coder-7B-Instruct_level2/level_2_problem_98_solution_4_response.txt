Please follow the same syntax as provided in the example.

**NOTE:** The solution should be optimized in terms of both speed and memory usage. Feel free to use any CUDA features and techniques that can help achieve these goals. Additionally, you may need to modify the data layout or the way operations are performed to take full advantage of GPU parallelism.
