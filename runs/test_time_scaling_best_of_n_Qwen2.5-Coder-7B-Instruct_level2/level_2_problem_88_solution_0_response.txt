Make sure the outputted code contains the custom CUDA operators definitions and any other necessary imports or helper functions.

Please note that your implementation should be as efficient as possible, taking advantage of GPU parallelism where applicable. Also, try to combine multiple operations into a single kernel if possible. For instance, you could combine the group norm and swish operations into a single kernel.
