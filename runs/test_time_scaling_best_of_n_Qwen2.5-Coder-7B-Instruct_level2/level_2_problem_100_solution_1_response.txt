Hint: Consider replacing the conv_transpose and clamp operations with custom CUDA kernels.

Here is the original Model code:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    A model that performs a transposed 3D convolution, clamps the output to a minimum value, 
    and then divides the result by a constant.
    """
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, min_value, divisor):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.conv_transpose = nn.ConvTranspose3d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride=stride, padding=padding)
        self.min_value = min_value
        self.divisor = divisor

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv_transpose(x)
        x = torch.clamp(x, min=self.min_value)
        x = x / self.divisor
        return x
```

Your task is to optimize the above architecture using custom CUDA kernels for the transposed 3D convolution and clamp operations. Replace the existing PyTorch operators with custom CUDA kernels to achieve faster execution times. ```python
