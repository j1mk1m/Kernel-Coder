Here is a list of PyTorch operations that can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels:

- `nn.ConvTranspose2d`: Transposed convolution operation
- `torch.mul`: Element-wise multiplication
- `torch.mean`: Global average pooling

You are encouraged to use operator fusion and algorithmic changes to further optimize performance.

**Note**: Your solution should aim to achieve the highest possible performance gain by leveraging CUDA parallelism and efficient memory access patterns.
