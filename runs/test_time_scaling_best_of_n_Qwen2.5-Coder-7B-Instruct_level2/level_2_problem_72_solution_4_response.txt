Please optimize the model to achieve maximum performance improvements. Feel free to use any CUDA optimization techniques such as shared memory, coalesced memory access, vectorized operations, etc. 

**NOTE:** Make sure to include all necessary imports and setup for your CUDA kernels. Your solution should be efficient and well-optimized. If you decide to fuse multiple operations together, ensure that the fused operation is mathematically equivalent to the original sequence of operations.

Here's a starting point to help you get started:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Example CUDA source code for a simple operation
conv3d_source = """
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Define a 3D convolution kernel here
__global__ void conv3d_kernel(...) {
    // Kernel implementation
}

torch::Tensor conv3d_cuda(torch::Tensor input, torch::Tensor weight, ...) {
    // Launch kernel and perform computation
}
"""

conv3d_cpp_source = (
    "torch::Tensor conv3d_cuda(torch::Tensor input, torch::Tensor weight, ...);"
)

# Compile the inline CUDA code for 3D convolution
conv3d = load_inline(
    name="conv3d",
    cpp_sources=conv3d_cpp_source,
    cuda_sources=conv3d_source,
    functions=["conv3d_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)

# Define the new model using the custom CUDA operation
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, bias_shape):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.conv3d = conv3d

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv3d.conv3d_cuda(x, ...)
        return x
```

Your task is to replace the existing PyTorch operators with efficient CUDA kernels and optimize the entire architecture for better performance. Feel free to experiment with different operations and optimizations. Ensure that the final model retains the same functionality as the original `Model`.
