Please note that the goal here is to optimize the performance of the given PyTorch model by replacing certain operations with custom CUDA kernels. You should focus on optimizing the performance of the model, rather than trying to replicate the functionality of the original model exactly. Feel free to modify the architecture, the operations performed, and the data types used as needed to achieve the best possible performance. 

The final output should be a working PyTorch model named ModelNew that uses custom CUDA kernels for certain operations. The model should produce the same output as the original Model when run with the same inputs. However, it should be faster due to the use of custom CUDA kernels.
