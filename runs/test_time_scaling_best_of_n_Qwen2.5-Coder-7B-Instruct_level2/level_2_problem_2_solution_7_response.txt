### Requirements:
- Use at least one custom CUDA kernel to optimize the model.
- Feel free to combine multiple operations into a single kernel or use algorithmic optimizations where applicable.
- Ensure that the functionality of the original model is preserved.

### Deliverables:
- A new class `ModelNew` with the optimized implementation using custom CUDA kernels.
- The new code should be compilable and fully functional.
