Note: If you choose to replace the Softmax operator with an alternative implementation, you can use the following formula:

Softmax(z) = exp(z - max(z)) / sum(exp(z - max(z)))

This formula helps prevent numerical instability when computing the exponential function.

Additionally, you may choose to implement any other optimization techniques such as operator fusion or algorithmic changes. Make sure your solution is efficient and maintains the functionality of the original model.
