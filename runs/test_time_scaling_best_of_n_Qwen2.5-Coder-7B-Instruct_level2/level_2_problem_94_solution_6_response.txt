Here's what you need to do:

1. Choose which operators to replace with custom CUDA kernels.
2. Implement these custom CUDA kernels.
3. Replace the chosen operators in the `Model` class with their corresponding custom CUDA kernels.
4. Ensure that the functionality of the model remains the same after the replacements.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Implement custom CUDA kernels here
# ...

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, bias_shape, num_groups):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize any necessary parameters or modules here
        # ...

    def forward(self, x):
        # Use the custom CUDA kernels instead of the original PyTorch operators
        # ...
        return x

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    batch_size = 1024
    in_features = 8192
    out_features = 8192
    bias_shape = (out_features,)
    num_groups = 256

    inputs = get_inputs()
    model = ModelNew(in_features, out_features, bias_shape, num_groups)
    outputs = model(inputs[0])
    print(outputs.shape)
```

Make sure that the provided code compiles without errors and produces the correct output. If you encounter any issues during implementation, please provide details so that they can be addressed.
