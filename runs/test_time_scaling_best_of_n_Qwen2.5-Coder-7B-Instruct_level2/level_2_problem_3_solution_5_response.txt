Note: The `nn.Parameter` should be handled in a way that it remains trainable during the optimization process. If there are any other parameters that need to be adjusted or replaced, please mention them in your explanation.

In order to ensure that your solution works correctly, provide a check function that takes the original model and the new model, along with some sample inputs, and verifies that the outputs are identical within a small tolerance level. For instance:

```python
def check_model(original_model, new_model, inputs):
    original_output = original_model(*inputs)
    new_output = new_model(*inputs)
    assert torch.allclose(original_output, new_output, atol=1e-5), "Outputs do not match"
```

Include the check function in your answer as well. 

Please also explain your reasoning behind each choice you made while optimizing the architecture. Provide comments in your code explaining why certain choices were made.
