The optimization should aim to achieve higher performance compared to the original implementation. Feel free to replace any part of the architecture with a custom CUDA operator, including but not limited to the transposed convolution, clamp operation, and division. Consider operator fusion, algorithmic changes, and other techniques to improve performance.

**Note:** You are allowed to use PyTorch's `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` function to compile and load your custom CUDA kernels. Ensure that your custom CUDA kernels are correctly implemented and integrated into the new architecture. ```python
