Replace the `Model` class with `ModelNew` and modify the `get_inputs()` function accordingly. Make sure all operations are performed using the custom CUDA kernels where applicable.

```python
def get_inputs():
    batch_size = 128
    in_channels = 3
    out_channels = 16
    depth, height, width = 16, 32, 32
    kernel_size = 3
    stride = 2
    padding = 1
    groups = 4
    eps = 1e-5
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, in_channels, depth, height, width)]
```

Please ensure that the code compiles and runs correctly without any errors. If there are any issues during compilation or execution, please provide the error messages so they can be addressed.
