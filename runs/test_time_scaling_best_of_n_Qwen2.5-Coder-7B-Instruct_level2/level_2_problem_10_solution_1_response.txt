Here's the list of PyTorch operators used in the original architecture:

- `nn.ConvTranspose2d` 
- `nn.MaxPool2d`
- `nn.Hardtanh`
- `torch.mean`
- `torch.tanh`

Please feel free to use any combination of these operators, combine them into a single kernel, or replace them with other operators to achieve maximum performance. Your goal is to optimize the architecture for speed while maintaining functionality.

### Note:
- You must include all necessary imports at the beginning of the code snippet.
- Ensure that the code is fully functional and compiles without errors.
- Do not output testing code.
- Your solution should be optimized for GPU execution.
