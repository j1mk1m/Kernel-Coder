Your solution should aim to optimize performance wherever possible. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of operations, fusions, and algorithms to achieve the best results.

Here's how I would evaluate your solution:

- Correctness: Does the optimized ModelNew produce the same output as the original Model?
- Performance: How much faster is ModelNew compared to Model? Provide benchmarks if possible.
- Complexity: Is the codebase simpler or more complex than the original?
- Creativity: Are there any novel approaches or optimizations used?

Please provide your solution within the next 24 hours.
