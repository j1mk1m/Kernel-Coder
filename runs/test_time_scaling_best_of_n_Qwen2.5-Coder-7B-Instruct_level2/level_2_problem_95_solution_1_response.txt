### Requirements:
- Optimize at least one operator using a custom CUDA kernel.
- Feel free to optimize any other operators using custom CUDA kernels or other optimization techniques.
- Ensure that the architecture remains functionally equivalent to the original `Model`.
- Document any significant optimizations or changes made in the comments within the code.

### Constraints:
- You must use PyTorch's `load_inline` API to compile and link the CUDA code.
- Your solution should be self-contained and clear, without relying on external libraries beyond those provided by PyTorch.
- The code should be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each optimization.

### Additional Considerations:
- If you combine multiple operations into a single kernel, ensure that the combined operation still produces the same result as the individual operations when executed separately.
- If you change algorithms, ensure that the new algorithm still produces the correct results for the specific problem domain.
- If you encounter performance bottlenecks, consider algorithmic improvements such as fused activations, reduced precision arithmetic, or other techniques to enhance performance.
