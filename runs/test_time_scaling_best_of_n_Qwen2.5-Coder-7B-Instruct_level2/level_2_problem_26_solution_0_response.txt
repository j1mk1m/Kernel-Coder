The code should include any necessary imports, including those from PyTorch, CUDA, and any other libraries you use.

Your code must include the definition of ModelNew, which inherits from nn.Module, and the implementation of the forward method using custom CUDA operators where applicable. Make sure to handle all tensors correctly, including data types and shapes. 

Do not include any unnecessary comments or explanations; just provide the code.
