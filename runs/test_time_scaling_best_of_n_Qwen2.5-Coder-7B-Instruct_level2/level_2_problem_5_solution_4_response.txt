Please follow the syntax provided in the example above for defining and compiling the custom CUDA kernels.

Here are some suggestions for potential optimizations:

- Transposed convolution can be implemented using a specialized CUDA kernel for better performance.
- Subtraction operation can be fused with the transposed convolution operation.
- Tanh activation can be implemented using a fast approximation method suitable for GPU computation.

Please ensure that the custom CUDA kernels are well-optimized and take full advantage of GPU parallelism. Additionally, please provide any necessary explanations for your choices in optimizing the architecture.
