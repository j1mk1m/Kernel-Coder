```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    ...
```

The code should include all necessary imports and definitions, including any additional helper functions or classes needed to implement the custom CUDA kernels. Make sure to follow the same structure as the example provided.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

...
```

Ensure that the ModelNew class can be instantiated and used with the same inputs as the original Model class. The forward method should perform the same operations but using the custom CUDA kernels where applicable.
