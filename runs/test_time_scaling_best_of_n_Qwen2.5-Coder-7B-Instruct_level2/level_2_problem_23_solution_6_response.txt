### Requirements:
- Replace `nn.Conv3d` with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Replace `nn.GroupNorm` with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Replace `x.mean(dim=[1, 2, 3, 4])` with a custom CUDA kernel.

You can use any CUDA features you wish, including shared memory, texture memory, etc. However, keep the implementation as simple and efficient as possible while ensuring correctness. Make sure to handle edge cases such as varying batch sizes and tensor shapes.
