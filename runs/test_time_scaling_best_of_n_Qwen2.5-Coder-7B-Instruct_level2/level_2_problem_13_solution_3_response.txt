### Guidelines:
- Replace any PyTorch operators with custom CUDA kernels where possible.
- Consider operator fusion to combine multiple operations into a single kernel.
- Feel free to use any PyTorch functionality for debugging or verification but ensure the final version uses only custom CUDA kernels.

Here's an example of how you might start implementing a transposed convolution using CUDA:

```python
# Define the custom CUDA kernel for transposed convolution
conv_transpose_source = """
// Your CUDA kernel implementation here
"""
```
