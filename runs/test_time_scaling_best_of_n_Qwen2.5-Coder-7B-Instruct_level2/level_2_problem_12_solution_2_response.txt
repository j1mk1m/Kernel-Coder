Please note that your implementation should be able to run on a GPU. Your solution should demonstrate how to use PyTorch's `load_inline` functionality to compile and use custom CUDA kernels. Also, please ensure that the custom CUDA kernels are efficient and well-optimized for the specific operations they perform.
