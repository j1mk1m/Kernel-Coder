    Your implementation should include at least one custom CUDA kernel. Feel free to add more if you think it would be beneficial. You may also fuse multiple operations into a single kernel if you believe it would improve performance.

Here's an example of what the final code might look like:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the custom CUDA kernel for convolution
convolution_source = """
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Custom convolution kernel implementation goes here...

torch::Tensor convolution_cuda(torch::Tensor input, torch::Tensor weight, torch::Tensor bias, int stride, int padding) {
    // Kernel implementation details...
    return output;
}
"""

# Compile the inline CUDA code for convolution
convolution = load_inline(
    name="convolution",
    cpp_sources=convolution_source,
    cuda_sources=[],
    functions=["convolution_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, divisor):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.conv = convolution
        self.divisor = divisor

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv.convolution_cuda(x, self.weight, self.bias, stride=1, padding=1)
        x = x / self.divisor
        x = torch.nn.functional.leaky_relu(x, negative_slope=0.01)
        return x
```

Note: The actual implementation of the custom CUDA kernels is left up to you. You can use any CUDA programming techniques you see fit to optimize the model. Remember to ensure that the custom kernels are correctly integrated into the PyTorch model and that they produce the same results as the original PyTorch operators.
