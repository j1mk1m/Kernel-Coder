Please use the following guidelines:

- Replace any CUDA-compatible PyTorch operations with custom CUDA kernels.
- Consider operator fusion opportunities to combine multiple operations into a single kernel.
- Optimize the architecture for speed while maintaining correctness.

Please provide the code for `ModelNew` and `get_init_inputs`. Make sure all necessary imports and dependencies are included. 

Note: This task requires a good understanding of both PyTorch and CUDA programming. It also requires careful consideration of memory access patterns and parallelization strategies to achieve optimal performance.
