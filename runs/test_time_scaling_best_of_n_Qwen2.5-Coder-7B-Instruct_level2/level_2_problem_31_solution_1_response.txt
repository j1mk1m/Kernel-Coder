Please note that I am looking for optimization of the entire architecture, not just individual operators. For example, you can combine multiple operations into one kernel or use more efficient algorithms.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your custom CUDA code here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, constant_value, bias_shape, scaling_factor):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Your custom layers or functions here

    def forward(self, x):
        # Your custom forward pass here
        return x
```
