Note: You can use any CUDA library function such as cuDNN, but do not use PyTorch's built-in CUDA operators. 

Please note that the optimization should aim to achieve speedup over the original implementation. To evaluate the effectiveness of your optimizations, you might need to run benchmarks before and after applying the optimizations. However, it's not necessary to provide benchmarking code here.
