    Feel free to experiment with different operators and techniques to achieve the best performance. Consider algorithmic optimizations such as fused batch norm and gelu, or using faster memory access patterns. Your goal is to optimize the architecture for speed while maintaining functionality.

    Note: You can use any additional libraries or tools you deem necessary for the optimization. However, ensure that they are available on all target platforms where the code will run.
