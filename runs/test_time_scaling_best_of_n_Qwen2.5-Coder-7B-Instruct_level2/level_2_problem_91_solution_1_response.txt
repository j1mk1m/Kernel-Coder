Here's how I would evaluate your solution:

- Correctness: Does the optimized `ModelNew` produce the same output as the original `Model`?
- Performance: How does the performance of `ModelNew` compare to `Model`? This can be evaluated using PyTorch's benchmark tools or simple timing measurements.
- Efficiency: Are the custom CUDA operators implemented efficiently? Consider memory usage, parallelism, and any potential bottlenecks.

Please ensure that your implementation adheres to these criteria.
