Please ensure that the output code is completely different from the given code. Avoid any copy-paste from the original code.

**NOTE:** You are allowed to use PyTorch extensions like `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` or `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load`. However, you should avoid using third-party libraries such as cuDNN or other CUDA-related libraries unless explicitly mentioned. Stick strictly to CUDA C/C++ and PyTorch's C++ API for creating custom CUDA operators.
