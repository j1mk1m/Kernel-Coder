Please note that while you can optimize any part of the architecture, it is highly recommended to focus on optimizing the parts that will provide the most significant performance gain. For instance, if the matrix multiplication is the most computationally intensive operation, then optimizing that part would be more beneficial than optimizing the ReLU activation function.

Also, please ensure that the final implementation does not introduce any bugs or errors. Make sure to test the implementation thoroughly before submitting it.

Here's a hint: You might consider implementing a custom CUDA kernel for the matrix multiplication and ReLU activation together, as these operations are commonly used together in neural networks and can be fused into a single kernel for better performance.
