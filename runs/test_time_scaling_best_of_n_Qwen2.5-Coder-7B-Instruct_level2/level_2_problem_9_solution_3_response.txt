Please do not use any third-party libraries other than PyTorch and CUDA.

### Hints:

- Consider replacing the matrix multiplication (`nn.Linear`) with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Explore opportunities for fusing operations together to reduce the number of kernel launches.
- Optimize the ReLU operation using CUDA intrinsics or a more efficient algorithm if possible.
- Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and reuse buffers where possible.
- Profile the original model and the optimized version to measure performance improvements.

### Expected Output:

The expected output should be a fully functional `ModelNew` class that implements the same functionality as the original `Model`, but with optimizations applied using custom CUDA kernels. Ensure that the code is well-commented and follows best practices for CUDA programming.
