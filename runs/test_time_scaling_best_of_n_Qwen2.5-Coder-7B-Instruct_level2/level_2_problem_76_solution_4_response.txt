Please use the provided `get_inputs()` function to generate inputs for your model. Feel free to modify it if needed. 

Please use the provided `get_init_inputs()` function to initialize your model. Feel free to modify it if needed. 

The `ModelNew` class should be fully functional and able to handle the same inputs as the original `Model`. It should also include any necessary initialization steps.

Your implementation should aim to optimize the performance of the `Model` by replacing certain operations with custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to experiment with different operators and combinations to achieve the best performance. Remember that the goal is to achieve speedup through custom CUDA kernels, so focus on optimizing the most computationally intensive parts of the model.
