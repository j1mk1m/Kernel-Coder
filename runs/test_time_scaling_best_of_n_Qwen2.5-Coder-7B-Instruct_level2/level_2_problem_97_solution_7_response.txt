Note: It is acceptable to use other libraries such as `torchvision`, `torchaudio`, etc. but they must be imported at the top of the file. You can also use any other PyTorch utilities as needed.

Please provide the full code including imports, class definitions, function definitions, and any other necessary components. Make sure that the code is self-contained and can be run independently.

Here's an example of how to use the provided architecture:

```python
model_new = ModelNew(*get_init_inputs())
inputs = get_inputs()
output = model_new(inputs[0])
print(output.shape)
```

Make sure that the output shape matches the expected shape based on the architecture definition. For the given architecture, the expected output shape should be `(batch_size, out_features)`.

```python
torch.Size([1024, 8192])
```
