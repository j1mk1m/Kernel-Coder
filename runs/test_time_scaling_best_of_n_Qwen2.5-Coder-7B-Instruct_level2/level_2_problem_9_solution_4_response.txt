Please ensure that your solution takes advantage of CUDA parallelism and efficient memory access patterns.

### Constraints:

- You can only use CUDA for optimization.
- You must keep the same function signatures for `get_inputs` and `get_init_inputs`.
- You cannot change the existing architecture significantly; focus on optimizing specific operations using CUDA.
- Ensure that the performance improvement is noticeable when compared to the original implementation.
