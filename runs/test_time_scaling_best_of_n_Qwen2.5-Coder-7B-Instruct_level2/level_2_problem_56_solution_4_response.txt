Please note that the goal here is to optimize the performance of the architecture using CUDA kernels, so feel free to experiment with different combinations of operators and algorithms.

Here's a hint: One way to potentially improve the performance could be to fuse the matrix multiplication and sigmoid operations together into a single CUDA kernel, as these operations can often be computationally expensive. Additionally, summing over the batch dimension can also be optimized using a reduction operation in CUDA.
