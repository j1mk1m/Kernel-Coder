Make sure to include any necessary imports at the beginning of the code.

Here's an example of how the final output should look:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Custom CUDA kernel definitions here...

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, bias=True):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize your custom modules here...

    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement your custom forward pass here...
        pass
```

Note: Ensure that all operations are correctly implemented using CUDA and that the output tensor has the same shape as expected from the original `Model`.
