```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    # Your implementation here
```

```python
def get_inputs():
    # Your implementation here
```

```python
def get_init_inputs():
    # Your implementation here
```

Please note that the goal is to optimize the performance of the `Model` class by replacing some of its operations with custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to use any optimization techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, etc. to achieve the desired speedup.

```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, scaling_factor, bias_shape, pool_kernel_size):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size)
        self.scaling_factor = scaling_factor
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(bias_shape))
        self.max_pool = nn.MaxPool2d(pool_kernel_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Replace some operations with custom CUDA kernels
        # ...
        return x
```

```python
def get_inputs():
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, in_channels, height, width)]
```

```python
def get_init_inputs():
    return [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, scaling_factor, bias_shape, pool_kernel_size]
```

Your solution should be efficient and provide significant speedup compared to the original implementation. Be creative and think outside the box!

```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, scaling_factor, bias_shape, pool_kernel_size):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size)
        self.scaling_factor = scaling_factor
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(bias_shape))
        self.max_pool = nn.MaxPool2d(pool_kernel_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Custom CUDA kernels for convolution, tanh, scaling, bias addition, and max-pooling
        # ...
        return x
```

```python
def get_inputs():
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, in_channels, height, width)]
```

```python
def get_init_inputs():
    return [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, scaling_factor, bias_shape, pool_kernel_size]
```
