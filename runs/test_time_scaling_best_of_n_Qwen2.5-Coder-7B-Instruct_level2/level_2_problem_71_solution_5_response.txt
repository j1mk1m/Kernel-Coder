Here's a guide on how to approach this problem:

1. Identify the operators that can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels.
2. Write the CUDA kernels for these operators.
3. Replace the PyTorch operators with the custom CUDA kernels in the `ModelNew` class.
4. Ensure that the new architecture works correctly and produces the same output as the original architecture.

Please provide the final implementation of the `ModelNew` class with the custom CUDA kernels. ```python
