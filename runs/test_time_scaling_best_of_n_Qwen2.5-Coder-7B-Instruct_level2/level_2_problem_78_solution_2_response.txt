Here's an example of how you would call the function:

```python
model_new = ModelNew(*get_init_inputs())
inputs = get_inputs()
output = model_new(inputs[0])
print(output.shape)
```

The output should be `(16, 1, 16, 16, 16)`.

Make sure to include any necessary imports at the beginning of the codeblock.
