The optimization should focus on improving the performance of the convolution operation and the Mish activation function. You can choose to replace any part of the architecture with a custom CUDA implementation, but you must provide a clear explanation for why each choice was made.

### Explanation of choices:

1. **Convolution Operation**: Choose the appropriate CUDA kernel for the convolution operation. Convolution is computationally intensive and can benefit significantly from parallelization on GPUs. A custom CUDA kernel allows fine-grained control over memory access patterns and can be tailored to specific hardware architectures.

2. **Mish Activation Function**: Implement a custom CUDA kernel for the Mish activation function. Mish is defined as \( \text{Mish}(x) = x \cdot \tanh(\sigma(x)) \), where \( \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \). This function can be implemented efficiently using CUDA's built-in hyperbolic tangent and exponential functions.

### Note:

- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernels handle edge cases such as padding and stride correctly.
- Use proper memory management techniques, such as shared memory and texture caching, to optimize performance.
- Consider using fused operations (e.g., convolutions followed by activations) to reduce the number of memory transfers between CPU and GPU.
