### Requirements:

- **ConvTranspose3d**: Implement a custom CUDA kernel for efficient 3D transposed convolution.
- **MaxPool3d**: Replace with a custom CUDA kernel for efficient 3D max pooling.
- **Softmax**: Optimize the softmax operation using a more efficient algorithm such as online softmax.
- **Subtract**: Implement a custom CUDA kernel for efficient element-wise subtraction across channels.
- **Swish**: Implement a custom CUDA kernel for efficient swish activation.
- **Max**: Implement a custom CUDA kernel for efficient max pooling across channels.

Please ensure that each operator is implemented in a way that maximizes performance while maintaining correctness. Your solution should aim to achieve significant speedup compared to the original PyTorch implementation.
