### Requirements:

- Replace `nn.ConvTranspose3d` with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Replace `torch.logsumexp` with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Replace `x * torch.sigmoid(x + 3) / 6` with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Replace `x - self.bias` with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Replace `torch.clamp(x, min=-1, max=1)` with a custom CUDA kernel.

### Hints:

- Consider using shared memory for intermediate results in CUDA kernels.
- Use atomic operations when necessary.
- Ensure that the CUDA kernels handle all edge cases properly, such as batch sizes, feature maps, and spatial dimensions.

### Notes:

- Your implementation should be efficient and maintain the same functionality as the original architecture.
- Feel free to add any additional helper functions or utilities as needed.
