Here's a hint: You might be able to optimize the transposed convolution operation by using cuDNN's optimized routines, but also consider other operations that could benefit from custom CUDA kernels.

Note: You can use the `load_inline` function from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile your custom CUDA kernels directly within your script. This allows you to seamlessly integrate your optimized operations into your existing PyTorch models without needing separate compilation steps.
