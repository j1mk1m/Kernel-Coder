Please note that the code should be efficient and use the appropriate CUDA techniques such as grid-stride loops, shared memory, etc. where applicable. 

Also, ensure that the functionality remains the same as the original Model.

To compile the inline CUDA code, you can use the `load_inline` function from `torch.utils.cpp_extension`. Make sure to include all necessary headers and define any additional functions or variables as needed. 

For the Mish activation, you can use the following formula:

Mish(x) = x * tanh(softplus(x))

Where softplus(x) = log(1 + exp(x)).

And for the Hardtanh activation, you can simply clamp the values between -1 and 1.

Here's how you can define the Mish and Hardtanh activations using CUDA:

```cpp
__device__ float mish(float x) {
    return x * tanhf(logf(1 + expf(x)));
}

__device__ float hardtanh(float x) {
    return fmaxf(-1.0f, fminf(1.0f, x));
}
```

Remember to include the `<cmath>` header for mathematical functions such as `log`, `exp`, `tanf`, `tanhf`, `fmaxf`, and `fminf`.

Finally, make sure to handle edge cases and potential errors appropriately in your custom CUDA kernels. Ensure that the output tensor has the correct shape and data type, and that any temporary buffers or resources are properly allocated and deallocated.
