The code should include the definition of ModelNew and any necessary imports. It should be possible to run the code directly after copying it.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your code here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    ...

```
