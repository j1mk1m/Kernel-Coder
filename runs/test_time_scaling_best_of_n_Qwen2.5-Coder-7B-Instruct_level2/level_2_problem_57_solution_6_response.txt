Please include any necessary imports at the beginning of the codeblock. If you use any helper functions or classes, please define them within the codeblock. If you need to compile any C++ code, please provide the full source code including any necessary headers. Make sure your code adheres to best practices and is well-documented.

Your implementation should aim to achieve maximum performance while maintaining correctness. Feel free to experiment with different approaches such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or custom CUDA kernels. 

Here are some tips to help you optimize the architecture:

- Consider replacing the ReLU operation with a more efficient version, such as inplace ReLU or approximate ReLU.
- Replace the HardSwish operation with a custom CUDA kernel, which can be faster than using PyTorch's built-in function.
- Combine multiple operations into a single kernel if possible, to reduce memory bandwidth and improve overall efficiency.
- Use appropriate padding and strides to avoid unnecessary computations.
- Experiment with different block sizes and grid sizes for your CUDA kernels to find the optimal configuration for your hardware.

Good luck optimizing the architecture!
