Please note that the goal is to optimize the performance of the given architecture using custom CUDA operators, so the focus should be on optimizing the computationally intensive parts of the model.

Also, feel free to introduce any other optimizations such as operator fusion or algorithmic changes that can further improve the performance of the model.

Finally, please ensure that the custom CUDA operators are correctly implemented and tested to ensure they produce the same results as the original PyTorch operators.
