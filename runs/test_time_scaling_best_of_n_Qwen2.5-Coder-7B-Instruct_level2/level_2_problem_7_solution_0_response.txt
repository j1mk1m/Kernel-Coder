Please note that while optimizing the architecture, it's okay to change the order of operations, fuse multiple operations together, and use any other optimization techniques you see fit. However, you should not introduce any new parameters or change the shape of the inputs or outputs. Only optimize the operations themselves using custom CUDA kernels. 

Your final implementation should be as efficient as possible while maintaining the same functionality as the original `Model`.
