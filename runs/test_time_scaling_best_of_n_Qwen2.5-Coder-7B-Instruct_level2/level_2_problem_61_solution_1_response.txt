Note: Your solution should focus on optimizing the transposed 3D convolution operation, which is likely the most computationally intensive part of the model. Consider using techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or custom CUDA kernels to achieve this goal. You are free to choose which operators to replace and how to implement them.
