Here are the steps to follow:

1. Identify the PyTorch operations that can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels.
2. Write the CUDA kernels for these operations.
3. Replace the PyTorch operations with the custom CUDA kernels in the `ModelNew` class.
4. Ensure that the `forward` method of `ModelNew` still produces the same output as the original `Model`.
5. Make any necessary adjustments to the `get_inputs` and `get_init_inputs` functions to accommodate the new architecture.

Please provide the full code for `ModelNew`, including all necessary imports and the definition of the CUDA kernels. Make sure the code is well-commented and easy to understand.
