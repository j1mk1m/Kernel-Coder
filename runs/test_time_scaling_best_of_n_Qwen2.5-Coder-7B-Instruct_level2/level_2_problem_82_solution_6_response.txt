### Guidelines:
- Replace as many operations as possible with custom CUDA kernels to maximize performance.
- Consider operator fusion opportunities.
- Feel free to change algorithms if it improves performance.
- Ensure the resulting `ModelNew` class maintains the same functionality as `Model`.

### Example:
- For the provided `Model`, one could replace the convolution operation with a custom CUDA kernel, fuse the tanh and scaling operations, and implement a custom max-pooling operation.

### Note:
- The solution should be self-contained and include all necessary imports.
- The solution should compile without errors when run on a GPU.
- The solution should maintain the same behavior as the original `Model` when executed on a GPU.

## Solution:

```python
