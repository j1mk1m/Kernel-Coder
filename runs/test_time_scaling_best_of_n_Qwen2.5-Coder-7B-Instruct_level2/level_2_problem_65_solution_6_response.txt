Note: Feel free to change the architecture as needed, but ensure it still performs the same computation. For example, you could combine the convolution and average pooling into a single layer or use different algorithms for the sigmoid function. The goal is to optimize performance using custom CUDA kernels.

Here's an example of how you might approach optimizing one of the operations:

- **Convolution**: Implement a fast convolutional operation using CUDA that avoids the overhead of calling PyTorch's convolution function.
- **Sigmoid**: Replace the PyTorch sigmoid implementation with a custom CUDA kernel that uses a more efficient algorithm, such as the tanh-sigmoid approximation.
- **Summation**: If possible, perform the summation directly within the CUDA kernel to avoid the need for additional memory accesses and computations in Python.

Remember to include any necessary imports and setup code at the beginning of your code snippet. ```python
