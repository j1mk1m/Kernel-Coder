Please ensure your code adheres to the guidelines provided. Your solution should include operator fusion and algorithmic changes wherever possible to achieve maximum performance gains.

### Note:
- Ensure that all CUDA code is well-commented to explain the functionality of each part.
- Make sure that the CUDA code handles edge cases appropriately.
- Ensure that the new model (`ModelNew`) has the same interface as the original model (`Model`).
