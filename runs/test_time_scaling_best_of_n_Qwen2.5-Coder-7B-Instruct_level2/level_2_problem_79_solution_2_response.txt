The code should be able to run the following commands:

```python
model_new = ModelNew(*get_init_inputs())
inputs = get_inputs()
output = model_new(inputs[0])
print(output.shape)
```

This should print `(128,)` which is the expected shape of the output tensor.

Please ensure that the implementation is efficient and leverages the power of CUDA. Your solution should aim to maximize performance while maintaining correctness.
