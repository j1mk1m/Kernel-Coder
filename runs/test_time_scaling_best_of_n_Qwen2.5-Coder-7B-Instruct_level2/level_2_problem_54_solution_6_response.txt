Your code should include the necessary imports and any other relevant code needed to run the architecture. Your solution should focus on optimizing performance through the use of custom CUDA operators.

**Note:** Feel free to use any PyTorch functionality that is available, but prioritize using custom CUDA kernels where possible to achieve the highest performance gains.
