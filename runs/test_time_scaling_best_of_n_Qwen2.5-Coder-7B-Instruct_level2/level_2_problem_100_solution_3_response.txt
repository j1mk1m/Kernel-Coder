Please ensure the output architecture maintains the same functionality as the original `Model` class.

## Requirements:

- Replace the transposed 3D convolution operation with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Implement the clamp operation using a custom CUDA kernel.
- Perform the division operation in the forward pass without using any additional CUDA kernels (use PyTorch operations).
- Ensure that the overall functionality remains the same as the original `Model`.
