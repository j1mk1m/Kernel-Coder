Your solution should optimize at least one of the following:

- Replace a PyTorch operator with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Fuse multiple PyTorch operators into a single CUDA kernel.
- Change an algorithm to improve performance.

Make sure to include all necessary imports, definitions, and any additional helper functions needed to compile and run the optimized model. The final code should be a fully functional implementation of the optimized `ModelNew` class that can be used to perform inference on inputs similar to those generated by the `get_inputs()` function provided.
