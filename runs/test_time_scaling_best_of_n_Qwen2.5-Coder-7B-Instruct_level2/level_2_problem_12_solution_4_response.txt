Please include all necessary imports at the top of the code snippet. Use the provided `get_inputs` function to ensure compatibility with the original model. The `get_init_inputs` function should remain unchanged. The output architecture should be fully compatible with the original model, i.e., it should produce the same output for the same inputs.

The optimization goal is to maximize performance, which may involve replacing PyTorch operators with custom CUDA kernels, fusing multiple operations into one kernel, or using more efficient algorithms. Feel free to experiment with different approaches to achieve the best performance. Remember that the custom CUDA kernels should be implemented in C++ and compiled with PyTorch's `load_inline` function.

Please provide a detailed explanation of your optimizations in a comment block above the `ModelNew` class definition.
