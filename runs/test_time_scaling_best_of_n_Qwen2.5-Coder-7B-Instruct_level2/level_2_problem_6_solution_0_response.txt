Here is how you can test the model:

```python
model = Model(*get_init_inputs()).cuda()

inputs = get_inputs()
outputs = model(*inputs)

print(outputs.shape)
```

This should print `(128, 16, 8, 16, 16)` assuming the input dimensions match the provided values. Make sure your implementation produces the same output as the original model.

Your goal is to achieve the best possible performance while maintaining the same functionality. Feel free to experiment with different optimizations such as replacing `torch.softmax` with an optimized version, fusing `convolution`, `softmax`, and `max pooling` operations, etc.
