Please follow the same pattern as the previous example to define the custom CUDA kernels and integrate them into the new architecture. ```python or ```cpp

### Requirements:

- You must use at least one custom CUDA kernel to optimize the `Model` architecture.
- Feel free to replace any part of the `Model` architecture with a custom CUDA implementation.
- Consider operator fusion opportunities or algorithmic changes to further optimize performance.

### Deliverables:

- A new class `ModelNew` that inherits from `nn.Module`.
- Inline CUDA kernels defined within the `ModelNew` class using `load_inline`.
- Ensure all operations are correctly implemented and the architecture behaves identically to the original `Model`.

### Note:

- The provided architecture includes a series of operations that can be parallelized or combined to reduce computational overhead.
- Feel free to experiment with different combinations of operators and algorithms to achieve the best performance.

### Example:

- If you decide to replace the `mish` activation with a custom CUDA kernel, you should also implement a corresponding backward pass if necessary.
```python or ```cpp

### Important:

- Ensure that your custom CUDA kernels are compatible with PyTorch's tensor data types and memory layout.
- Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure it matches the behavior of the original architecture.

### Hint:

- You might find it helpful to review the PyTorch documentation on custom C++ extensions and CUDA programming to understand how to define and use custom kernels.
```python or ```cpp
