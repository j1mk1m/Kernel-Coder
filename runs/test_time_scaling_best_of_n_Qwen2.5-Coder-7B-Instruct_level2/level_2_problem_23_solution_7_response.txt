### Constraints:
- You can use any PyTorch operators.
- You cannot use PyTorch's `nn.functional` module for non-linear operations like ReLU or Softmax.
- You must implement your own CUDA kernels for these operations.
- You can choose which operators to optimize and whether to fuse them.
- Your solution should be efficient in terms of both time and memory.

### Additional Notes:
- Feel free to add any necessary imports at the beginning of your code.
- Ensure that your implementation maintains the original functionality of the `Model`.
- Optimize the performance of the model by replacing inefficient operations with custom CUDA kernels.
- If possible, combine multiple operations into a single CUDA kernel to reduce overhead.

Here's an example of how you might start implementing a custom CUDA kernel for a 3D convolution:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the custom CUDA kernel for 3D convolution
conv3d_source = """
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Implement the 3D convolution kernel here...

torch::Tensor conv3d_cuda(torch::Tensor input, torch::Tensor weight) {
    // Kernel implementation...
    return output;
}
"""

conv3d_cpp_source = (
    "torch::Tensor conv3d_cuda(torch::Tensor input, torch::Tensor weight);"
)

# Compile the inline CUDA code for 3D convolution
conv3d = load_inline(
    name="conv3d",
    cpp_sources=conv3d_cpp_source,
    cuda_sources=conv3d_source,
    functions=["conv3d_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, num_groups):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.conv = conv3d
        self.group_norm = nn.GroupNorm(num_groups, out_channels)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.group_norm(x)
        x = x.mean(dim=[1, 2, 3, 4])
        return x
```

Make sure to provide a fully working implementation that meets the requirements outlined above.
