The final solution should be a working implementation of the ModelNew class with all the necessary imports and definitions. The code should compile and run without errors.

Please provide a brief explanation of the optimizations made and how they contribute to performance improvements.

Here's an example of how I would use the provided code to get the inputs:

```python
inputs = get_inputs()
model = Model()
output = model(inputs[0])
print(output.shape)
```

This will output the shape of the tensor produced by the model when it is passed the inputs generated by `get_inputs()`.
