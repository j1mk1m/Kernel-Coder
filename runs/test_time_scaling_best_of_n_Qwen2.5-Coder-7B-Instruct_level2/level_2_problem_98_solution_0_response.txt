Please note that you can use any PyTorch operators you wish, but the goal is to optimize the performance using custom CUDA kernels. You are encouraged to combine operators and create fused operations where possible. For example, instead of calling `avg_pool` followed by `gelu`, you could fuse these operations into a single kernel. 

Make sure to include all necessary imports and any other setup code required to compile and run the optimized architecture.
