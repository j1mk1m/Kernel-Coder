Here are some guidelines for optimization:

- Replace any convolutional layers (`nn.Conv2d`) with custom CUDA kernels. Consider using efficient convolution algorithms such as Winograd or FFT-based convolutions.
- Replace the `GroupNorm` layer with a custom implementation if it can be done more efficiently than PyTorch's default implementation.
- Replace the `MaxPool2d` layer with a custom implementation if it can be done more efficiently than PyTorch's default implementation.
- Replace the scaling operation (`x * self.scale`) with a custom CUDA kernel if it can be done more efficiently.
- Replace the clamping operation (`torch.clamp(x, self.clamp_min, self.clamp_max)`) with a custom CUDA kernel if it can be done more efficiently.
- Feel free to combine multiple operations into a single kernel if it can improve performance.

Please provide the optimized code in the requested format.
