Make sure that your code includes all necessary imports and that it can be run independently. 

The final answer should look something like this:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Add your custom CUDA code here...

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, multiplier_shape, clamp_min, clamp_max):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize your custom CUDA operators here...
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement your forward pass using custom CUDA operators here...
        return x
```

Please note that your solution must provide a significant speedup compared to the original implementation. Your custom CUDA operators should be well-optimized and take full advantage of GPU parallelism.
