Here are some guidelines for optimization:

- Choose which operators to replace with custom CUDA kernels based on potential performance improvements.
- Consider algorithmic optimizations such as fused operations.
- Ensure the code remains readable and maintainable.
- Test the optimized architecture to ensure it produces the same results as the original.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the custom CUDA kernel for transposed convolution
conv_transpose_source = """
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Custom implementation of transposed convolution
// This is just a placeholder; actual implementation details will vary
__global__ void conv_transpose_kernel(...) {
    // Kernel implementation goes here
}

torch::Tensor conv_transpose_cuda(torch::Tensor input, torch::Tensor weight, ...) {
    // Function implementation goes here
}
"""

conv_transpose_cpp_source = (
    "torch::Tensor conv_transpose_cuda(torch::Tensor input, torch::Tensor weight, ...);"
)

# Compile the inline CUDA code for transposed convolution
conv_transpose = load_inline(
    name="conv_transpose",
    cpp_sources=conv_transpose_cpp_source,
    cuda_sources=conv_transpose_source,
    functions=["conv_transpose_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)


class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, output_padding, multiplier):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.conv_transpose = conv_transpose
        self.multiplier = multiplier

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv_transpose.conv_transpose_cuda(x, self.weight, ...)  # Use the custom transposed convolution kernel
        x = x * self.multiplier
        x = torch.mean(x, dim=[2, 3], keepdim=True)  # First global average pooling
        x = torch.mean(x, dim=[2, 3], keepdim=True)  # Second global average pooling
        return x

# Initialize inputs and model
inputs = get_inputs()
model_new = ModelNew(*get_init_inputs())

# Forward pass through the model
output = model_new(inputs[0])
print(output.shape)
```

Please provide the full implementation of `conv_transpose_source` and any other necessary parts of the code. Ensure that the code compiles and runs correctly without errors.
