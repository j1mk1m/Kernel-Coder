The optimized architecture should be faster than the original one. To measure performance, use `timeit.timeit` or similar profiling tools. If there is any performance improvement, report it in the comment section.

```python
import timeit

model = Model(*get_init_inputs()).cuda()
inputs = get_inputs()[0].cuda()

start_time = timeit.default_timer()
output = model(inputs)
end_time = timeit.default_timer()

print(f"Original Model Time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

Please also include a brief explanation of why certain operators were chosen for optimization and how they contribute to the overall speedup. Feel free to experiment with different operators and combinations to achieve the best possible performance.
