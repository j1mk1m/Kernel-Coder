Please note that you can use PyTorch extensions such as `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` to compile your custom CUDA kernels. If necessary, feel free to include any additional imports at the beginning of your code.

Here is an example of how to use `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline`:

```python
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

custom_op_source = """
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Define your custom CUDA kernel here...

torch::Tensor custom_op_cuda(torch::Tensor input) {
    // Implement your custom operation using CUDA...
    return output;
}
"""

custom_op_cpp_source = (
    "torch::Tensor custom_op_cuda(torch::Tensor input);"
)

custom_op = load_inline(
    name="custom_op",
    cpp_sources=custom_op_cpp_source,
    cuda_sources=custom_op_source,
    functions=["custom_op_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)

# Now you can use custom_op.custom_op_cuda in your code
```

Ensure that your custom CUDA kernels are efficient and take advantage of parallelism available on the GPU. Consider optimizing memory access patterns, minimizing synchronization, and leveraging CUDA libraries like cuBLAS and cuDNN where appropriate. 

Remember that while custom CUDA kernels can provide significant performance improvements, they also require careful implementation and testing to ensure correctness and stability.
