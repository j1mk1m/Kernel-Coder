Please note that you can use PyTorch C++ extensions to create custom CUDA kernels, but you do not need to use them if you prefer to use PyTorch's `torch.cuda` API directly. If you choose to use PyTorch's `torch.cuda` API, please ensure that your custom CUDA kernels are compatible with it.

Here is a reference for PyTorch's `torch.cuda` API: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cuda.html

Please provide the full implementation of `ModelNew`, including any necessary imports, CUDA kernels, and the definition of `get_inputs()` and `get_init_inputs()`. Your implementation should be efficient and utilize the power of CUDA for parallel computation.
