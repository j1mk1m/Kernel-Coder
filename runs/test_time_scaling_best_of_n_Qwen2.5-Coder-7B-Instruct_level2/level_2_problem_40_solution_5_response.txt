The goal is to optimize the performance of the given PyTorch model using custom CUDA kernels. Feel free to use any optimization techniques such as operator fusion, algorithmic changes, or other strategies to achieve the best possible performance. Make sure to document any changes made to the original architecture and explain why they were chosen.
