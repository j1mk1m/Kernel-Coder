### Guidelines:
- Feel free to choose which operators to optimize.
- Consider operator fusion opportunities.
- Make algorithmic changes where appropriate.
- Ensure the final architecture is fully functional.

### Note:
The provided architecture uses PyTorch's built-in operators. Your task is to identify which of these can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels to achieve performance improvements.
