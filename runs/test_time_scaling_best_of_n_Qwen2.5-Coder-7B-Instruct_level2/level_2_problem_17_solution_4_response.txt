    Note: If you use any PyTorch functions, they should be standard PyTorch functions, not those that were replaced by custom CUDA kernels.

Here is a hint on how to approach this problem:

- Identify the operations in the original `Model` that can be efficiently implemented using CUDA.
- Implement these operations as custom CUDA kernels.
- Replace the corresponding operations in the `forward` method of `Model` with calls to the custom CUDA kernels.
- Ensure that the custom CUDA kernels handle all edge cases and boundary conditions correctly.
- Test the optimized model to ensure it produces the same results as the original model but runs faster.
