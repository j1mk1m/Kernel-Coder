Here are the steps I would like you to follow:

1. Analyze the operations in the original architecture and identify potential candidates for optimization with custom CUDA kernels.
2. Write custom CUDA kernels for these identified operations.
3. Replace the corresponding operations in the original architecture with calls to these custom CUDA kernels.
4. Ensure that the modified architecture maintains the same functionality as the original one.

Please adhere strictly to these guidelines. If you need any clarification or have questions, feel free to ask.
