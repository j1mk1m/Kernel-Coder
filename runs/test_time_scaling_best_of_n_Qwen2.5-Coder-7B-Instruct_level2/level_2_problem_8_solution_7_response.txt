The solution should include:

- A description of the optimizations made.
- The new architecture `ModelNew` with custom CUDA operators.
- Any additional code needed to compile and run the new architecture.

### Constraints:

- The code must be self-contained and compilable.
- The code must work with PyTorch 1.10.0 or later.
- The code must be compatible with CUDA 11.0 or later.
- The code must use the `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline` function to compile the custom CUDA code.
- The code must be written in Python.
- The code must not use any external libraries other than those provided by PyTorch and CUDA.
- The code must be able to handle inputs of the same shape as the original architecture.
- The code must produce the same output as the original architecture when given the same inputs.
- The code must be optimized for speed, with a focus on reducing the number of GPU operations and improving memory access patterns.
- The code must be well-documented, with clear comments explaining each step of the optimization process.

### Example Solution:

The following example demonstrates how to optimize the `Model` class using custom CUDA operators. The example uses the `load_inline` function to compile the custom CUDA code, and then defines a new class `ModelNew` that replaces the original operators with custom CUDA kernels.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define the custom CUDA kernel for 3D convolution
conv3d_source = """
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Custom 3D convolution kernel implementation goes here

torch::Tensor conv3d_cuda(torch::Tensor input, torch::Tensor weight, torch::Tensor bias, int stride, int padding, int dilation) {
    // Kernel implementation goes here
    return output;
}
"""

conv3d_cpp_source = (
    "torch::Tensor conv3d_cuda(torch::Tensor input, torch::Tensor weight, torch::Tensor bias, int stride, int padding, int dilation);"
)

# Compile the inline CUDA code for 3D convolution
conv3d = load_inline(
    name="conv3d",
    cpp_sources=conv3d_cpp_source,
    cuda_sources=conv3d_source,
    functions=["conv3d_cuda"],
    verbose=True,
    extra_cflags=[""],
    extra_ldflags=[""],
)

# Define the new architecture with custom CUDA operators
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, divisor, pool_size, bias_shape, sum_dim):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.conv = conv3d
        self.divisor = divisor
        self.max_pool = nn.MaxPool3d(pool_size)
        self.global_avg_pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d((1, 1, 1))
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(bias_shape))
        self.sum_dim = sum_dim

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x, self.weight, self.bias, stride=1, padding=1, dilation=1)
        x = x / self.divisor
        x = self.max_pool(x)
        x = self.global_avg_pool(x)
        x = x + self.bias
        x = torch.sum(x, dim=self.sum_dim)
        return x
```

This example shows how to define a custom CUDA kernel for 3D convolution and use it to replace the original `nn.Conv3d` operator in the `Model` class. The example also includes the necessary code to compile the custom CUDA code and define the new architecture `ModelNew`.
