Here are some things to consider:

- Replace `nn.ConvTranspose2d` with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Replace `x - self.bias` with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Consider replacing `torch.tanh` with an efficient alternative, such as `online_tanh`.
- Consider operator fusion if possible.

Please provide the full implementation of ModelNew, including the CUDA kernels. 

Note: This problem requires knowledge of CUDA programming, PyTorch C++ extensions, and optimization techniques. If you're not familiar with these topics, you may need to do additional research to understand how to implement them correctly. Good luck!
