Please note that the provided architecture already includes some operations that can be optimized using PyTorch's built-in optimizations such as `GroupNorm` which has a fast implementation in PyTorch. However, you should still aim to optimize other operations where possible.

Also, please make sure that your custom CUDA kernels are properly defined and included in the compilation process. Use the `load_inline` function from `torch.utils.cpp_extension` to compile your CUDA kernels.
