Please note that I am looking for optimizations specifically related to the operations performed within the Model class, such as the transposed convolution, batch normalization, and average pooling. Feel free to use any CUDA features to optimize these operations. Your goal should be to achieve higher performance compared to using PyTorch's built-in operators.

### Hints:

- **Transposed Convolution**: Consider using efficient algorithms for transposed convolutions, such as the Winograd algorithm or other fast methods.
- **Batch Normalization**: Implement a batch normalization kernel that can handle large batches efficiently.
- **Average Pooling**: Use CUDA's parallel processing capabilities to perform average pooling quickly.

### Note:

- You are allowed to change the architecture of `ModelNew` as needed to achieve better performance. However, ensure that it still produces the same output as the original `Model`.
- Make sure to include all necessary imports at the beginning of your code.
- Ensure that your custom CUDA kernels are correctly implemented and integrated into the `ModelNew` class.
- Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure correctness and performance gains.

## Solution:

Provide the optimized `ModelNew` code here.
