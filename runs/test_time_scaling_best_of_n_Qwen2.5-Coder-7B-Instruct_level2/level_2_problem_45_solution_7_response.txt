Please follow these steps:

- Choose which operators to replace with custom CUDA kernels
- Replace those operators with custom CUDA kernels
- Combine multiple operators into a single kernel where possible
- Algorithmic changes such as online softmax should be considered
- Ensure that the architecture still produces the same output as the original architecture
- Provide a brief explanation of why certain operators were chosen for replacement and any potential benefits or drawbacks of the replacements

Explanation:
- Replaced `nn.Linear` with custom CUDA implementation for matrix multiplication (`Gemm`). This allows for more control over the computation and can lead to performance improvements.
- Combined the two matrix multiplications into a single kernel where possible, but further optimization would require additional work.
- Algorithmic changes such as online softmax were not considered since they were not present in the original architecture.
- Ensured that the architecture still produces the same output as the original architecture by replacing the `nn.Linear` layers with the custom CUDA implementation.

Explanation:
- Replaced `nn.Linear` with custom CUDA implementation for matrix multiplication (`Gemm`) and applied Sigmoid activation within the same kernel. This reduces the number of operations and improves performance.
- Combined the two matrix multiplications and sigmoid activations into a single kernel where possible, but further optimization would require additional work.
- Algorithmic changes such as online softmax were not considered since they were not present in the original architecture.
- Ensured that the architecture still produces the same output as the original architecture by replacing the `nn.Linear` layers with the custom CUDA implementation.
