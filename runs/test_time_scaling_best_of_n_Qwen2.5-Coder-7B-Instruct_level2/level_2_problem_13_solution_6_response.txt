### Requirements:
- Replace the transposed 3D convolution (`nn.ConvTranspose3d`) with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Replace the mean pooling operation with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Combine the addition and softmax operations into a single custom CUDA kernel.
- Replace the tanh activation with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Replace the scaling operation with a custom CUDA kernel.

### Deliverables:
- A working implementation of `ModelNew` that uses the custom CUDA kernels for all specified operations.
- Ensure that the architecture behaves exactly the same as the original `Model`.
- The code should be fully functional and compile without errors.
