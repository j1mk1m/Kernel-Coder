Please note that while it is okay to include CPU operators in the ModelNew class, any CUDA operators should be implemented using the `load_inline` function from PyTorch extensions.

Here is a hint on how to approach the problem:

1. Identify the operations in the Model class that can benefit from custom CUDA kernels.
2. Write the CUDA kernels for these operations.
3. Use `load_inline` to compile and link the CUDA kernels.
4. Replace the original operations with the custom CUDA kernels in the ModelNew class.
5. Ensure that the overall functionality of the Model remains intact after optimization.

Please provide the full implementation of ModelNew in the specified format.
