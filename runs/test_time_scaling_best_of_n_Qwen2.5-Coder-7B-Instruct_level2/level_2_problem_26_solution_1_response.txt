Please note that you can use any PyTorch functionality that does not involve CPU/GPU communication except for the `get_inputs` function. You can also use any PyTorch functionality that does not involve the actual computation but only defines the computational graph.

### Requirements:
- Replace the 3D transposed convolution operation (`nn.ConvTranspose3d`) with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Optionally, optimize other operations such as the addition and HardSwish activation.
- Ensure that the final architecture remains compatible with the original inputs and outputs.
- Provide the full code for the new architecture (`ModelNew`).
