### Note:

- You are allowed to use any CUDA features, such as shared memory, texture memory, etc., but please ensure they are used appropriately.
- Feel free to modify the architecture or add additional parameters as needed to achieve the desired performance improvements.

### Constraints:

- Ensure that the new architecture maintains the same functionality as the original one.
- Optimize the computation as much as possible while keeping the model structure intact.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure readability of the code.
