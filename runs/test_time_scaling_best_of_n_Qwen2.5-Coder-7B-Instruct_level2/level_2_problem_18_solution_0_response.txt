Your solution should include both the new architecture definition (`ModelNew`) and any necessary helper functions or CUDA kernels. 

Note: You are free to use any combination of PyTorch operations and CUDA kernels to optimize the performance of the given architecture. However, you must ensure that the final output remains consistent with the original architecture.

To verify that your solution works correctly, run the following code:

```python
model_new = ModelNew(*get_init_inputs())
x = get_inputs()[0].cuda()
y = model_new(x)
print(y.shape)  # Should print torch.Size([1024, 1])
```

This will create an instance of `ModelNew`, pass it the input tensor, and print the shape of the output tensor to ensure it matches the expected output shape.
```
