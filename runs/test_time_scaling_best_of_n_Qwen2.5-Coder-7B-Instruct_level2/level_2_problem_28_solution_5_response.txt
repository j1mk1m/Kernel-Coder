Your solution should include:

1. A detailed explanation of why certain operations were replaced with custom CUDA kernels.
2. Any additional preprocessing or postprocessing steps required for the inputs or outputs of the custom CUDA kernels.
3. The actual implementation of the custom CUDA kernels.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Define custom CUDA kernels here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, eps=1e-5, momentum=0.1):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        self.bmm = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)
        self.instance_norm = nn.InstanceNorm2d(out_features, eps=eps, momentum=momentum)

    def forward(self, x, y):
        x = self.bmm(x)
        x = self.instance_norm(x.unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(1)).squeeze(1).squeeze(1)
        x = x + y
        x = x * y
        return x

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    batch_size = 1024
    in_features = 8192
    out_features = 8192

    model_new = ModelNew(in_features, out_features)
    x, y = get_inputs()
    output = model_new(x, y)
    print(output.shape)
```
