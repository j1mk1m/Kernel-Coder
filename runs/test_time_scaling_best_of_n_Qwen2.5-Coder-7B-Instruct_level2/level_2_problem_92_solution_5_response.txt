```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your custom CUDA kernels here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, groups, eps=1e-5):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Define your layers here using the custom CUDA operators

    def forward(self, x):
        # Use your custom CUDA operators in the forward pass
        return x_logsumexp
```

Please note that you should aim to optimize the performance of the entire model, including the convolution, group normalization, tanh, hardswish, residual addition, and logsumexp operations. You may use any combination of custom CUDA kernels, operator fusion, and algorithmic changes to achieve your goal.

```python
# Example usage:
model_new = ModelNew(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, groups)
input_tensor = get_inputs()[0]
output_tensor = model_new(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape)
```

Your solution should be efficient and take full advantage of GPU parallelism. Make sure to handle edge cases and ensure the correctness of your implementation.
