Make sure to use proper variable names and follow good coding practices. Your solution should aim for high performance and readability.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Identify the operators that can be replaced with custom CUDA kernels.
2. Write the CUDA kernels for these operators.
3. Replace the original PyTorch operators with the custom CUDA kernels in the `forward` method of the `ModelNew` class.
4. Ensure that the new architecture (`ModelNew`) maintains the same functionality as the original architecture (`Model`).

Provide the final implementation of `ModelNew` in Python using PyTorch. Make sure it compiles and runs without errors.
