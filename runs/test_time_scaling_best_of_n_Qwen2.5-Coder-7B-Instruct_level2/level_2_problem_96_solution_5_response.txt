Here are the steps you should follow:

1. Analyze the operations performed by the original `Model` class.
2. Identify which operations can be optimized using custom CUDA kernels.
3. Write the CUDA kernels for these operations.
4. Integrate the CUDA kernels into the `ModelNew` class.
5. Ensure that the `forward` method of `ModelNew` produces the same output as the original `Model`.

Note: Feel free to modify the operations, combine them, or use different algorithms as long as they improve performance.

### Expected Output

The expected output should include the `ModelNew` class with the optimized CUDA kernels integrated. The code should compile and run without errors, producing the same output as the original `Model`. ```python
