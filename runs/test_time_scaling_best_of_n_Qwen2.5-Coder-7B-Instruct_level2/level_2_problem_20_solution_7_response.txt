Your answer should include the definition of `ModelNew`, any necessary imports, and the `get_inputs` and `get_init_inputs` functions. Make sure all operations are correctly replaced with custom CUDA kernels when possible.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Your custom CUDA kernels here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, output_padding, bias_shape):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize layers and parameters

    def forward(self, x):
        # Replace PyTorch operations with custom CUDA kernels
        return x

def get_inputs():
    # Generate inputs for the model

def get_init_inputs():
    # Generate initialization inputs for the model
```

Please ensure your solution is efficient and correct, and that it adheres to the guidelines provided.
