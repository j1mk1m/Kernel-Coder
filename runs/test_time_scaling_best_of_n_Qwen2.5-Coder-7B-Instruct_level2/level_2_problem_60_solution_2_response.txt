Please ensure that all custom CUDA operators are thoroughly documented in comments within the code. Explain any decisions made regarding which operators to replace and why.

**Note:** The goal here is to maximize performance by leveraging GPU acceleration where possible. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of operators and techniques to achieve the best results.
