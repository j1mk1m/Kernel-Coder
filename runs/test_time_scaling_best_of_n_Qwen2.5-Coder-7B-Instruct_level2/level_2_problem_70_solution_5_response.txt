Please note that you should be able to run the new model using the same `get_inputs` function provided above. Also, the model should produce the same output as the original model when run with the same inputs. To ensure this, you can use the following check:

```python
model_original = Model(input_size, hidden_size, scaling_factor)
model_new = ModelNew()

x = get_inputs()[0]

output_original = model_original(x)
output_new = model_new(x)

assert torch.allclose(output_original, output_new), "The outputs do not match!"
```

Make sure that the assert statement does not raise any errors.
