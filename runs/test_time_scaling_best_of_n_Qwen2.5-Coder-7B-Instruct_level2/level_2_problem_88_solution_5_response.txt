```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    # Your implementation here
```

Note: Feel free to use any libraries and tools you deem necessary for the optimization.

### Requirements:
- Replace at least one PyTorch operator with a custom CUDA kernel.
- Consider operator fusion opportunities.
- Use appropriate data types and memory access patterns for optimal performance.
- Ensure the custom CUDA kernels maintain the same functionality as their PyTorch counterparts.
- Optimize the overall computation graph for better throughput.
