The goal is to achieve speedup through custom CUDA kernels. You should optimize at least one operation but feel free to optimize more operations to further increase performance. Be creative and use the techniques described above. For instance, you can combine multiple operations into a single kernel, use efficient algorithms, or leverage parallelism.
