Your solution should focus on optimizing the performance of the model, particularly for large batch sizes and high-dimensional data.

### Constraints:
- The model must maintain its functionality (i.e., it should produce the same output as the original `Model`).
- You can only use PyTorch operations that are available in PyTorch's C++ API.
- Your implementation should be efficient and take advantage of GPU acceleration where possible.
- Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and ensure that the code is clean and readable.
