Please note that your custom CUDA operators should be efficient and well-implemented. Consider using techniques such as shared memory, coalesced memory access patterns, and parallelism to optimize performance.

Also, ensure that the functionality of the original model remains intact after optimization. That means the output of Model and ModelNew should be identical when run with the same inputs.
