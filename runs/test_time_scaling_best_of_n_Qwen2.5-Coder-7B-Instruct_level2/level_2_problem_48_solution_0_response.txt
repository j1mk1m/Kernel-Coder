Please note that I am looking for a comprehensive solution that takes advantage of CUDA's parallel processing capabilities to optimize the entire model. You should aim to reduce the number of operations and improve memory access patterns where possible. Feel free to combine multiple operations into a single kernel or use different algorithms to achieve better performance.

Your solution should be efficient and take full advantage of GPU resources. It should also maintain the same functionality as the original model. 

```python
class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    ...
```
