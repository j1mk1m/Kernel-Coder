Please follow the same pattern as the example provided above, where you define the CUDA kernel, compile it, and then use it within your `ModelNew` class.

Here is a list of potential operations that could be accelerated with custom CUDA kernels:

- 3D Transposed Convolution (`nn.ConvTranspose3d`)
- Scaling Operation (`x * self.scale_factor`)
- Batch Normalization (`nn.BatchNorm3d`)
- Global Average Pooling (`nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d`)

Feel free to choose which operations to optimize and how to combine them. For instance, you might fuse the scaling operation into the transposed convolution kernel or implement batch normalization using a more efficient algorithm.
