Hint: You can use torch.cuda.Stream to improve memory bandwidth utilization. For example, you could create two streams and perform matrix multiplication and sigmoid computation in parallel.

```python
stream1 = torch.cuda.Stream()
stream2 = torch.cuda.Stream()

with torch.cuda.stream(stream1):
    x = self.matmul(x)

with torch.cuda.stream(stream2):
    x = x * torch.sigmoid(x)
```

```python
x = x * self.scaling_factor
return x
```
