Please use the following template:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

# Custom CUDA kernel definitions go here

# Compile the inline CUDA code here

class ModelNew(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, scale_factor, eps=1e-5, momentum=0.1):
        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()
        # Initialize layers using custom CUDA operators where appropriate

    def forward(self, x):
        # Forward pass using custom CUDA operators where appropriate
        return x
```

Make sure to include all necessary imports and define any additional helper functions or classes as needed.
